* remark-mdx: This plugin allows you to use MDX (a combination of Markdown and JSX) in your Markdown files, which can include other Markdown files, React components, and more. This can be a powerful way to include dynamic content in your Markdown files.

* remark-import-partial: This plugin allows you to include parts of other Markdown files in your main file by specifying a specific heading or range of lines to include. This can be a good option if you only need to include specific sections of other files.

* remark-glob: This plugin allows you to include multiple files that match a specific glob pattern. This can be a good option if you have a large number of files to include and want to automate the process.

* remark-rehype: This plugin allows you to use HTML in your Markdown files, which can include content from other HTML files. You can use this in combination with the rehype-include plugin to include content from other HTML files.

* remark-extend: This plugin allows you to extend your Markdown syntax with custom syntax elements, including custom include syntax. This can be a good option if you have specific syntax requirements that are not met by other plugins.
