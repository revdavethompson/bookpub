# BOOM!-THEME

The Boom! theme comes from an article by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie and Bert Bos

[Printing a Book with CSS: Boom!
](https://alistapart.com/article/boom/)

The idea behind Boom! was to demonstrate the use of MicroFormats in HTML to designate all the parts of a printer-ready published work through the use of class names and standard CSS3 elements.

This has been tested and works well with the [PrinceXML Framework](https://princexml.com) for converting html/css/javascript to print-quality typeset media.
