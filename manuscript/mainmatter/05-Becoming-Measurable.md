## Coming to Terms

"What are you wearing?"

A text from the Sheriff popped up on my screen.

I was happy to see it, even if it did give me a laugh. Every text was at very least a small reminder that I wasn't alone, and every little bit of that helped.

I reached out my arm, somehow snapping a selfie, attaching it to a message.

"Bule rain jacket dork green felt hat".

I hit send and prayed the reception would stay long enough to send the picture. I figured my picture would be far more useful than my hard-to-read texts.

On my phone, alongside the pending message, a progress animation popped up. I fixed my gaze on it, and my hope. The small spinning wheel turned over and over again, leaving me motionless, like a gambler holding their breath at a slot machine. I found myself unable to look away, addicted to the possibility of another small moment of success on this barren rock.

Much to my relief, the word *sent* appeared.

After a short while, the Sheriff replied, "I can only imagine what it’s like up there, but help is on the way. State Ranger dispatch is coordinating with their ranger and according to the map, you’re not very far from the road."

I appreciated the Sheriff's encouragement. I truly did. I considered myself lucky to have someone who knew the importance of encouraging someone during a traumatic experience.

But underneath the cheerful optimism of the Sheriff, something small caught my attention.

My eyes paused over the last line of his text..." you're not very far from the road".

It was a true statement...sort of.

Yes, if someone were to look at a map, I wasn't far from the road. The narrow two-lane mountain highway was only a mile away from my location if they were to draw a straight line.

But what the map didn't show, was that along that line, in between myself and the road, lay an impassable labyrinth littered with sharp jagged rock, massive boulders and cliffs with dramatic drops.

The unfortunate reality? By foot, the only true route to reach me on Table Rock was anything but close.

The trailhead actually began much further back on the highway. From there the trail snaked its way along the backside of the mountains, through nearly three miles of brutal rocky terrain. As if that wasn't bad enough, the trail itself was riddled with unmarked off-shooting trails and patches of rough baldfaced rock with no visible trail at all.

Though I understood and appreciated the Sheriff's bedside manner, it had the reverse effect on me. I knew the truth. I had just hiked the trail only hours ago and I knew the harsh reality that awaited the rescue team. I could only hope he did as well.

But what if he didn't?

Something else hit me. Something worse.

If they were assuming I wasn't far away, had they also made similar assumptions about the conditions on the top of the mountain?

The nearest weather station was in Calistoga.

The small town sat at the base of the mountain, nestled on the northernmost tip of the Napa Valley. If they were looking at the information from Calistoga's weather station, they would be looking at a very different picture of the weather.

According to that station, it was a chilly yet tolerable forty-six degrees, with moderate rain and winds.

Calistoga was at 354 feet. It was slightly stormy down there, but it was hardly life-threatening from their point of view.

But I was at nearly 7000 feet. It was a whole different ballgame up here.

Were they thinking I was only just uncomfortable? Cold and wet, but with no real threat to my life? Did they think that I would be fine on this rock after dark?

I had to stop myself. This wasn't helping anything and would only continue to create unnecessary stress from hypotheticals. I had enough to worry about, without inventing more problems.

I had no choice but to push the thoughts away. Rather than worrying about it, I assumed the Sheriff was simply trying to paint an optimistic picture and put me more at ease.

I would have probably done the same if I were in his shoes.

<div class="section" id="emotions">

## Unexpected Emotions

Another text popped up on my screen. This time from home.

"Just talked with the sheriff, they are coordinating with the Rangers already up there. They feel really good about the rescue. They want you to remain calm and stay where you are. Love you, babe."

I replied, "Love you're j".

I meant to say "Love you too", but I had to assume the message was received.

Of all the mountainous obstacles I was already enduring, this one seeming small hitch hit me hard. To not be able to type "Love you too" to my spouse of nearly ten years, was more than I could bear.

With every text I sent, I knew it could be my last.

At any moment, any number of uncertainties could end my ability to communicate. My battery could die. My phone could short-circuit from the water. My signal could drop. I had to make every message count.

As I sat there looking at the text, something began to grow inside me. Churning amidst the torrent of emotions within me, I felt something that I had never felt before, and it did not feel good.

There was something more to this particular moment. Some elusive emotion that I couldn't immediately place. It wasn't anger. It wasn't sadness, fear or despair. It was something else completely; something selfish and surprising to me.

It was envy.

Of all of the many things to feel in that moment. Envy? I didn't want to entertain the thought, but I couldn't help myself.

A dark unbearable truth unfolded before me, one that I hadn't thought of before. Nor did I even want to consider it again.

There was a strong possibility that I might not make it. This could very well be my end.

But my spouse would go on living.

It wasn't a thought I had ever considered, and it leveled me a cold hard blow.

This wasn't in the plan. We were supposed to live our entire lives together.

All of the picture-perfect plans and eager ambitions. I wouldn't be there. All of our must-see bucket-list destinations. I would never go. All of the exciting adventures. I wouldn't be there to experience them.

Even all of the inevitable heartaches, the bitter break-ups and the my-fault make-ups.

I wouldn't be there.

The thought took hold of me, gripping me hard, and pulling me down into a dark place.

But I knew I had to let go of it. There was no benefit to be served in dwelling on sad ideas.

</div>

<div class="section" id="bad-signs">

## Bad Signs

A throbbing ache in my knees was becoming too much to ignore, pulling me away from the sadness. It was hardly the distraction I wanted, but it was the distraction I needed.

Nestled into the massive stone behind me, I sat huddled in a fetal position, hugging my legs to my chest. It was the one thing I knew would help in my desperate attempt to preserve body heat.

What little I could feel was now isolated to a throbbing, almost stabbing ache in my knees.

I needed to stretch my legs.

It was an easy thing to take for granted; the simple straightening of a leg. A common string of events carried out in perfect relay: the firing of a singular charge by grey matter; the conducting of the signal along a super-highway of a million different interconnected neurons, down the spine, to the legs; at last firing-off the muscle, contracting it and moving the leg in the necessary direction.

Just like every time before, I saw my leg pull out and slowly straighten, finally laying down on the wet ground beneath me. But something was different: something was wrong.

This time, as I had straightened my leg, I hadn't felt a thing.

It was a surreal experience, like trying to move my own legs, only to see someone else's move instead. I couldn't feel any of the usual sensations. Had I been blindfolded, I don't know that I would have known my legs had straightened at all.

I ran my hands down the length of them. Nothing. None of the familiar sensations of touch or pressure. There simply was no feeling at all.

I sat there staring blankly, poking at my lifeless limbs with my fingers, like a child poking curiously at some dead snake he found. My legs were just lying there, completely still, perfectly still.

My stomach turned inside me as I came to understand the full weight of what this meant.

I had been losing body temperature for nearly two hours. The lack of shivering, the numbness, these were all signs that pointed to one inevitable conclusion.

My hypothermia was progressing.

I was running a race against time, and time was winning.

</div>

<div class="section" id="what-that">

## What Was That?

It was getting later now. Closer to sunset. I didn't want to admit it, but I knew that I didn't stand a chance once the sun went down and the temperature dropped.

I flipped back to the Sheriff's message and then to the one from home. I read them over and over again. Each time, I found my gaze stopping upon one particular phrase, "...the Rangers already up there."

"*...already up there?*"

The question turned over and over in my mind.

*What did that mean? Were the rangers "up there" at the trailhead, or "up there" on top of Table Rock?* The difference meant the difference between life and death.

*They must be down at the trailhead. There's no way they could get up here in such a short time.*

The longer I thought about and questioned it, the more I began to doubt myself.

It was hard to imagine that the rangers could have hiked up to Table Rock in just over an hour. But, if they were the type who jogged up mountain trails, it was certainly possible. I had encountered those types many times before when I was hiking. God knows I wasn't one of them.

So, it was possible.

If that were the case, they could be on the flat top right now looking for me. It seemed ludicrous at first. But the more I churned it over and over in my head, the more plausible it became.

Here's the rub...If they were already up on the flat top, that *was* a problem, because I wasn't.

I was nowhere near the top.

My make-shift shelter was past the ridgeline, down and over a bit, off to the side. If the rangers were up there, there would be no way for them to see or hear me. Add to that the roaring wind and drowning rain. From where I was, there was little chance that I would hear them.

I could choose to go up and look for them, but then I would be facing the storm head-on, in all its rage. Every second I spent up there would mean an increased chance of losing body heat.

I couldn't risk losing any more than I already had.

It was a tough decision. Go up, lose heat, and possibly find rescue? Or stay and wait for them, slow my heat loss, and risk not being found.

I sat there mulling over the two equally terrible choices. Neither of them was overly appealing, but nothing about my situation was.

Such was life; being left to choose only between lesser evils.

"....aaaaaayyyyy..."

Something caught my attention, something off in the distance. It was a faint sound carried on the wind---barely a whisper.

I shot my head around to see what it was.

I couldn't see anything through the dense fog. But I knew I heard something muffled off in the distance.

*What was that?!*

My heart started to pound in my chest. I froze, motionless, twisting my ears around to the left and the right, like a spooked deer, listening for its prey.

I waited...

and waited...

"...aaaaavvvveeee"

I heard it again! But dang, it was nearly indistinguishable, muffled by the bustling wind.

*Was that a voice?! Did someone just yell my name?!*

I strained to pick up some sliver of sound. Any sound. I moved my head from side to side, attempting to reduce the bellowing blasts of the wind. I was struggling, hoping to hear something, but the effort seemed as pointless as picking out a single voice in a stadium of roaring fans.

I must have heard it. I had to have heard it.

I pressed my neck forward till it hurt, desperately attempting to hear the faintest sound.

"...bweeeeeeeeeeeeet..."

Something else. Something, again faint. But this wasn't a voice. It was different; a sort of high-pitched trilling sound.

*Was that a whistle?!*

I braced myself against the stone, grabbing its side and pulling up as hard as I could. I stretched to my side, leaning out over its edge. I had to look. Maybe I would be able to see something.

"bweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet"

 Another faint whistling sounded, this time coming from a slightly different angle.

*It wasn't possible, was it?*

Just then I thought I saw something. A flicker of light?!

*Oh, God! Are they already up here?! They can't be.*

There was no way they could have already arrived at the top, was there? It was too hard to believe.

But I wanted to believe it. I needed to.

I clicked my phone on, glancing down at the time. There's no way they could have made it to the top in such a short time.

But what if they had?

Did I misunderstand the Sheriff about the timetables?

It was possible. If the rangers knew the area well and were in really good shape, it might be possible.

But what would it matter, if I didn't get up to the rock while they were calling out to me? I might miss my window of opportunity. They might eventually assume I had found my way off and was making my way back.

Still, I couldn't be wrong about this.

If I went up on top, I'd be back in the full force of the wind and the rain. The temperature had now fallen closer to freezing and the wind continued blowing the rain sideways at twenty to thirty miles per hour.

But I had to go up and check, didn't I? This might be it. This might be my one and only chance to be found. It would be worth it all if I were found.

My mind drifted to that blissful thought, wrapping itself up in the idea of it. It was intoxicating. The euphoria of being rescued. It took hold of me, cradling me in the long-familiar stories and miraculous rescues I had so often heard in the padded pews of my church.

So often I would listen as people shared their moments of astonishing experience; when some light, some sound, some angel led them mysteriously to the perfect place or to the right person at the right time to rescue them.

Maybe this was my moment, my story. Maybe, finally, it was my time to have some remarkable rescue from the storm. Surely, after all, that I had endured throughout my life, this was it. After my many decades of ministry and service to my fellow ministers, to people of faith, and to humankind, this was my time.

I would finally have my own story to tell!

I found myself growing excited with anticipation.

I poured myself wholly into it; my newly renewed hope. It was exactly what I needed.

If I was going to find my miracle, I needed to get out and get up there. If this was my salvation, who was I to dispute it or let it go by?

I committed myself to it, pushing all of my many doubts aside. It was all too easy. Without so much as a second thought, the several so-called discrepancies began fading away, replaced by an unfaltering trust in the miracle I knew I so well deserved.

It was time.

</div>

<div class="section" id="miracle">

## My Miracle

I dug deep, mustering the willpower to raise myself up.

Gripping ahold of the rock's edge, I pulled up hard, pressing my back against the stone face to brace myself. With a final heave, I pushed off, praying that I would find my legs beneath me. Up I stood, finally, swaying awkwardly on uncertain limbs, like a newborn fawn standing for the first time.

The branches of the nearby white manzanita bush offered themselves to me. I turned and gripped ahold tight. Carefully navigating the scattered shale pieces beneath me, I straddled myself between the bush and the dark drop-off below. It was a tricky maneuver, but I came around quick and readied myself for the short climb up to the top once again, of Table Rock.

The ridgeline at the top edge of the rock didn't seem that far away when I left to find my shelter. It was only a stone's throw away.

But as I gazed up at the steep slippery climb, three things hit me at once: One, it didn't seem far earlier, because I was going downhill. Two, I was finding it difficult to coordinate on numb legs. Three, every movement, every single step required all of my mental and physical focus.

There was no time to lose...I began up the hill.

One…Two…Three…I counted my steps with a deliberate determination. It gave me something to do and kept my mind distracted from all the chaos around.

All I could manage was a few steps at a time. But with each step, I found myself gaining more hope.

Hope is what I needed and I drank deep of it. It coursed through me, waking every part of me, offering a renewed optimism---the rangers were up there and I was on my way to redemption.

It was that optimism that renewed something else in me that I hadn't expected, nor had I seen for a very long time.

Deep inside me, buried under forty years of life lessons learned hard, something, no, someone else had awakened. A long-forgotten bright-eyed young man struggled to stand and make himself known again. I was surprised to see him, still there, unwavering, and unwilling to let go. He held fast with both arms outstretched. With his left hand, he gripped firmly onto my will. With the other, he gripped even tighter to a tattered leather-bound book.

I felt his hopefulness pushing me along with each step I took.

After everything I had been through these many years, I'll be honest. I didn't even know he was there. But here he was.

All these long years he had been waiting. Patiently waiting. Waiting with undying devotion. Waiting to see something spectacular. Something undeniable. Something supernatural.

He was waiting for his miracle, and now, so was I.

Four…...... Five…........ Six…........ With each step I took my time, preparing myself for what was to come. I went over every zipper, button, and tie-down, preparing myself for the full measure of the storm ahead.

Miracle. The word itself had nearly become irrelevant to me in our modern age of science and technology. But it wasn't irrelevant for him. In his youthful heart, he held scrupulously to the many tales of far more desperate moments. Each one of them met with their own marvelous and mysterious miracle.

He was an eternal optimist; the product of a thousand flowery sermons, dozens of dramatic presentations, and hundreds of made-for-TV specials. He could see nothing but our rescue; our glorious rescue. It was the way of things, at least for him, and "The Faithful Chosen". This was the long-awaited ending he had been taught to expect and had been patiently waiting for all his life.

His vision took me over and I lost myself in it, in his stage-lit expectations. It was all too familiar and I needed the distraction.

---
> **Title:** *"On Table Rock"*
>
> **Setting:**
> - *Low-lit rocky ground*
> - *Heavy Fog & strong fans*
> - *Rain & wind sounds*
>
> **Scene:** *"The Rescue"*
---

The curtain draws open on an empty stage.

The scene opens with a gently feathered spotlight shining down on me, climbing up a small embankment off to the side, and leading up to the stage. A second spotlight sits on the side of the stage, awaiting something, or someone to arrive.  A storming soundtrack begins to play, surrounding the stage and enveloping the room.

With each step up the embankment, the lights increase slightly. The stage, now becoming more visible, shows a rocky floor swallowed in a thick haze of fog machines.

Something amazing was about to happen. He was almost at the top now.

The storming soundtrack ever-so-slowly begins to fade away into the background, replaced by a piano playing with delicate high-rolling chords. Then, just as he arrives on the mountain-top stage, the music begins to crescendo in dramatic degrees, adding one-by-one, strings, woodwinds, timpani and brass. A great swelling wave of music, building and building, till suddenly it all drops away, leaving a lone note, held by a flute, hovering in its great absence. A single note, hanging in the air, unwavering. Until, a solo violin takes it over, and turns it into a phrase of such delight.

This was the moment...movie magic!

The rangers step into their spotlight. The music builds again with a dramatic score as they finally see each other across the rock-covered stage.

I run to them. They run to me.

Then, just as I arrive, I collapse at their feet, spent of my every last strength.

Seven…Eight…Nine…I pushed my phone deeper into my pocket and tugged my hat down as far as I could.

Back on stage, the rangers cover me with a warm blanket, feeding me and giving me something to drink.

Finally, I am found! And this...this is all over.

The lights fade away steadily, leaving a single spotlight on me, which in turn begins to fade away into darkness.

The End.

Ten......Eleven................Twelve.......................I was at the ridgeline.

I left the dramatic presentation behind, prepped and ready for the real rescue scene to start. Only one lunging step remained between me, the rangers, and the howling storm, just over that ridgeline.

One simple step.

I took in a dramatic breath, pulled my coat tight around me and let out a prayer for good measure, "God help me!"

</div>

<div class="section" id="broken">

## The Broken Truth

I lifted a weary leg over the ridgeline and stepped onto the flat. Then, pushing off with my other leg, I swung it around to the other side of the ridge and leaned in.

The sheer force of the wind threw me back against the ridgeline with brute force. I pushed back, leaning squarely in. Planting my feet firmly into the ground, I braced myself while I found my balance and my bearing.

Holding my hand up in front of me, just past the brim of my hat, I formed a shield, sheltering my eyes from the pelting rain. The view was still difficult to see, but I began looking out over the top of Table Rock, searching for my miracle.

This was my moment.

I strained to peer out as far as I could see, muscling every ounce of hope that my bright-eyed fellow could manage. He gave it his all, ready for the moment he had been waiting for his whole life.

At first, I didn't see anything, but that didn't stop me. I leaned harder into the wind and made another peering pass over the rocky flat, now dotted with hundreds of little pools of water.

Nothing.

There was no one to be seen.

I strained to listen for the hollering voices I was so certain I had heard.

Nothing.

No voice was calling my name. No whistle sound was ringing out. There was nothing.

Just, nothing.

Nothing...but the rock, the rain, the wind, the fog, and me.

My heart dropped hard like a stone in water, falling swiftly down into despair.

Where was it? My miracle? My well-deserved miracle?

My built-up hope gave way, collapsing out from under me, demolished by the crushing disappointment. And under the rubble, lay the young man, with his thousand flowery sermons, his tearful dramatic presentations, his reels of films portraying their picture-perfect endings.

He was laid to ruin.

The disappointment gave way to something else...desperation. A long life's worth of healthy happy endings, all bleeding out onto the rocky truth of life, life as it was and had always been.

My desperation boiled up from deep within me, gathering its equal measure of fury and fear. From every secret place, it gathered together all of my hidden resentments and regrets, pooling them and twisting them into a raging river of molten feelings. The pressure kept building and building, more and more, channeling itself finally into a volcanic eruption of gut-wrenching anger and tears.

"HELLOOOOOOOO!!" I screamed at the top of my lungs.

The storm swallowed my sound whole like a starving beast.

I waited.

*Please! Dear God, Please!*

Nothing.

No lights. No sounds. No people. No rescue.

Once again the harrowing hopelessness boiled up, erupting with every strength I had in me.

"HEELLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"

The sound faded into the mist and confirmed the terrible truth I had already come to realize.

I was alone.

I collapsed down, exhausted and dizzy from the effort. I caught myself on one knee and knelt there.

Waiting...listening...for what felt like a lifetime.

Still...nothing.

The silence. It broke me. Shattering my soul into a thousand pieces.

I pulled myself up on my feet and stood there, empty and absent of myself as I knew it. There was nothing left. No hope. No optimism. No bright-eyed young man. Not even anger or despair.

Nothing. Just, nothing at all.

Had the rain not drowned my face, I might have realized I was weeping. But those tears weren't because of the unforgiving rock around me. They weren't because of the unrelenting storm. Not even the icy cold temperature could claim its victory.

It was the silence. And it killed every last part of me.

It was then that I realized what it meant. I had imagined it all.

No one had called my name. No one had whistled for me. There was no one even here.

It meant that my rescuers had only recently arrived at the trailhead. They were just getting started. There would be no way for them to get to me in time before the sun went down.

It meant something else too.

My hypothermia was advancing into the end stages. It may well have been what caused me to misinterpret, or even hallucinate the lights and sounds in the first place. I would need to expect confusion and disorientation from here on out.

I had now run out of options.

For the first time in my life, I felt alone. Truly alone.

Before, I had always had God. But here on this mountaintop, amidst my most dire need, God was nowhere to be seen.

It was perhaps the greatest measure of disappointment in my life.

It was me and only me.

There would be no glowing angel to lead me to safety. There would be no bright light in the sky to lead me off. If I was going to survive, it wouldn't be from some supernatural intervention. I would have to figure it out myself.

It was only the measurable that could help me now: temperature, gravity, velocity---cold hard measurable science.

All my life had been spent measuring the unmeasurable, proving the improvable; to the neglect of all the truth around me.

This whole time on the mountain, whether I knew it or not, I had been waiting for a miracle, taking a back seat to my own survival.

Was God out there somewhere? I'd like to think so, but I had no way of knowing. For now, I had to attend to my rescue myself.

</div>

<div class="section" id="new-plan">

## A New Plan

Sitting there in the thick of it wasn't doing me any good.

Pulling myself back up on my feet again was no small task. But much to my surprise, I discovered that the wind could be useful in the endeavor. With my back to the wind, I stretched out my arms like a kite, trying to catch it as much as possible. By leaning into it, I was able to use the wind to push myself upright.

It was a little tricky, but leveraging the wind, gave me the chance to save my strength a little. Being already exhausted, I would need to save every bit of it for later.

Stepping over the ridge was easy enough. With the wind at my back, I let it push the mass of me forward while lifting each leg over the rocks.

The shelter sat down the side of the rock a fair bit and I wondered if I had the energy to go back down only to later make my way back up again.
There were too many unknowns to head back down just yet. Instead, I let myself fall back against the rocky ridgeline and slid down till I was sitting with my legs pulled back into my chest again. I needed to think through my plan again before I took another step. This time, however, I would need to base my decisions solely on what I knew was measurable and true.

I set my mind to work, thinking of every possible aspect I could. Temperature. Wind-speed. Rain. Body-temperature. Hypothermia. Altitude. Body mass. Gravity. Distance. Energy.

It was a lot to consider.

Normally, I wouldn't have had any difficulty, calculating all of my odds. This time, however, all the factors began to bleed into each other, creating a jumbled mess of details in my mind.

I was finding it hard to keep my head on a single task, let alone make basic calculations. I decided to try and use my phone to write some notes and use the calculator, but the rain made that impossible. Not to mention, I needed to conserve what battery power I had left.

My trip back up to the top of the mountain provided little in the way of positive outcomes. One small but important insight was gained. I knew now that the rescue party wasn't anywhere close. They were still down at the trailhead, or at least not far away.

That meant only one thing---(1) there would be no way for them to get to me before the sun set, and (2) after that, I would have no chance of surviving on top of this rock, sheltered or not.

It was now nearing 4 o'clock and the sun would be setting in an hour or so. The temperature was only dropping slowly for now, but I knew that once the sun went down, it would drop fast, and close to freezing.

I couldn't be here when that happened.

That left me with only one option; one that I did not want to consider. I would have to find my way off the rock, or die trying.

The idea of climbing off the top, let alone making my way back, was overwhelming.

I was tired. Dog tired. Ready to throw in the towel.

Unfortunately, even the small amount of time I spent up on the flattop had already taken its toll.

Now, all I wanted to do was close my eyes and sleep.

Sleep. It had never sounded so enticing to me before. Ten minutes was all I needed. Just a short nap.

Never mind that I was approaching the final stages of hypothermia, and every minute would bring further confusion and lack of coordination.

But why not?

The rangers would eventually be coming for me. They had my exact GPS location. I might as well spend the time sleeping till they got there. At least I would be able to recharge a bit.

My mind gave way to the illusion.

I imagined them wrapping me in some sort of blanket with a few of those warming pods that heat up when exposed to air.

In the back of my mind, I knew it wasn't real. But the fantasy of it all was too soothing to let go of.

Being found. Being enveloped in a warm dry blanket. Being freed from the lonely chaos. Free from the cold. Free from the wind and rain. Free from the aching pain, the fear and the panic.

I found myself relaxing into it, falling into the feathered feeling of a soft and safe sleep. Finally, I could let go, drift off, and dream, deeper than I ever had before.

It was all...to...easy......

For the briefest of moments, I felt myself slipping away, enveloped in a warm and serene sensation, like leaning back into a heated pool of honey, I felt what I can only describe as absolute rest. True, peaceful, deep rest.

Everything disappeared. Every fear fell away. Every terror turned to tranquility. Every worry drifted down---down into that perfect rest.

...

A sharp pain jolted me awake.

A stabbing pain, somewhere on the back of my head, broke me mercilessly out of my slumber. I was in a daze, my ears ringing, confused as to where I was.

The pain wove its way around my skull, all the way to the front of my forehead, pounding...hard.

All in the span of a second, it all came flooding back to me in a massive deluge of panic and pain. Everything. I was back on the mountaintop again, cold to my core, afraid and alone.

Instinctively, I reached around and grabbed the back of my head to feel for an injury. It was pointless. I no longer had any feeling in my hands.

Regardless, I brought it back around quickly to examine it.

A crimson streak of red swirled around the pool of water in my palm.

I was bleeding!

The sight of the blood pushed a shot of adrenalin through my veins. It was hardly a blessing, but it gave me a fortunate boost of energy, and I needed it.

I sat there in disbelief.

*I fell asleep!*

If my head hadn't hit the rock, would I have even woken up? Ever? The thought terrified me.

I didn't want to acknowledge it, but I was going to have to do something. I couldn't just sit there. If I did, I might fall asleep again and probably never wake up.

The sun was going to start setting in another hour. If I was going to stay, I would be gambling against the house and the odds were overwhelmingly not in my favor.

There was still a chance that the Rangers could find me in time. But that would never happen if I stayed on Table Rock. The only chance I had was to find my way off the rock, start back down the trail, and gain as much ground as I could before all the light was gone.

It was a gamble, but so was everything at this point.

I had no idea if I could find my way off the top. Thankfully there were only two possible exits left on the rock to try. But I would likely only have enough time to choose one. It would be a fifty-fifty shot, but that was better than the certain death of waiting up here in the storm.

This was it. I needed to go. Now.

This storm was never going to stand still. Neither could I.
