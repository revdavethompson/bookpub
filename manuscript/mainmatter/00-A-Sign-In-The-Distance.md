# A Sign in the Distance

“Finally!!”

Just up the trail ahead, a slender sign emerged from out of the mountaintop mist, marking my destination and thankfully, the end of my arduous hike.

Exhausted from the climb, I leaned over, bracing my hands against my knees and taking in a few lung-fulls of the thin damp air.

*I made it.*

Two grueling hours of hiking up the rain-weathered rock trail left me plain tuckered out.

I wasn't expecting the hike to be quite so challenging. So it was a great relief to now see the end in sight.

A hesitant sort of triumph took hold of me. On the one hand, I was thrilled to have made it to the rock. But on the other, I hadn't planned or prepared on going so far. That worried me, especially in the cold drizzling weather.

Even so, I took hold of my small success and chose instead to embrace the accomplishment. It stood me upright and drove me back into a steady pace toward the trail marker ahead.

Only a few yards before me, a monolithic mass of ancient magma rose straight up, disappearing into the sky. A lone path cut itself into the side of the rock, bearing the look of some ancient passage to a hidden realm beyond the clouded firmament above.

There, at the base of the trail, the plain brown metal marker stood with an unmistakable irony, almost hidden against the black rock and tufts of hay-colored grass surrounding it.

Two humble words stood out, clear and distinct, begging every would-be traveler to take heed and to measure the cost.

The inscription, etched in bone-white block lettering, read as much like an epitaph as it did a warning:

## In the Beginning

As kids, we were started early in nature.

My father was a farmer-practical man who firmly believed that we should know just as much about living off of nature as we knew about living in society. Though the two were never mutual mutually exclusive.

There in the great outdoors, we came to understand our purpose, walking in the faded footprints of human ancestors, who so long ago, walked there as we did now.

It should come as no surprise then, that I spent untold hours trouncing through the wilderness; whether fishing, hunting, camping, or simply hiking just to enjoy the great outdoors.

Long before I ever learned to drive, I spent many a day following my father through the woods as we hunted. The right of passage often came with a repeating soundtrack of 'sushing' sounds from my father who somehow managed to walk with the stealth of a ninja, despite never looking down.

Even still, of all the many facets of life I've come to enjoy, few activities have brought me such renewal and recreation as a simple walk through the woods.

There amidst Nature's unreserved realism, I coucanld walk alone, center-stage. There I can walk, an audience of one, in an ancient play, absent of our modern trappings of lights, scripted reality, and staged sets. Instead, I am surrounded by the wonderful and unpredictable happenings of life unaltered and unadulterated, as it has been since the curtains first rolled back on our empty earth.

I loved it, because only there could I remember my place and my purpose in life---life as it truly was.

This was the one place where I could feel my most significant release from the pressures of our chaotic world. At the trailhead, I could unburden myself and leave the cares of the world behind, freeing myself to observe things as they truly were---boundless, beautiful, and brutal.

It was the one place where I could give my thoughts their full weight, measured against the unchangeable rules of an ever-changing universe.

***

On that particular morning, I needed the trail more than ever. The questions weighing me down were foundational and difficult to unravel. They required more than just a simple contemplation. They would require time, and a lot of it.

As a Gen-Xer, I was a person pulled between two worlds---on one side, a world where we were governed by our ancient rules and customs. But in the other, our modern world, we were still wrestling to find a common direction. As so, I was in desperate needed of asking myself what I truly and actually believed, and more importantly, what my role could be in helping our fledging world find some common ground.

That was no small task, and I needed the wilderness to help me do it.

For the better part of five years, I had called Lake County, CA, my home. The truly rural region boasted a sparse population of some twenty-five thousand residents.

There amist its kindred community, there stood a prominent primordial volcano, and the largest natural lake in California. The lake itself was ancient; the oldest lake in North America, and one of the oldest in the world. It was a place where history lay scattered along the old-world shores, and the voices of its earliest human civilizations some twenty-thousand years removed still carried on the wind.

I couldn't have asked for a more perfect place to be. The land possessed a serene sort of solitude, being composed for the most part of National Park wilderness. Suffice to say, there were few places where I could have better spent my time reflecting.

There, surrounded by the earliest echoes of our human history, I could contemplate my calling and my purpose in our modern world.

It was for that very reason that, earlier that morning, I decided to hike off into the wild. Had I known the danger that lay in store for me, I would never have walked out the door.

As was my custom, I started the day by stopping at my favorite Lakeport bakery, Angelina's, to grab some coffee and one of their famous brownies (because who wouldn't?).

The small two-lane county road meandered over and through the brown wooded oaks and green pines of the coastal mountain range. Starting from the southern part of the lake, in Kelseyville, the road passsed over Cobb Mountain, down through the valley and Middletown, and finally back up into the mountains just north of Calistoga, CA.

The last little section of road led me high up into the coastal mountains, to the trailhead of my final destination. Past that point, the road took a sharp grade and began to snake down into the Napa Valley and the town of Calistoga below.

As I approached the parking area, I slowed the car and pulled it off into a small flat of dirt just off the left side of the road. There wasn't much in the way excess room, so I parked as far away from the road as possible.

Opening the door, I stood up, admiring the stunning scenary of old-growth trees and fern carpeted forest floors around me. I took in a deep breath, enjoying the pleasant perfumed scent of sweet pine and soil-scented moss.

It was a perfect day to hike.

A mystical mist hung lightly in the air, painting a lightly brushed scene from out of a childhood fairytale. There in the distance I could imagine the magical forest, filled with fairy-folk and fables, inviting its eager travelor to discover their quest and their purpose therein.

The weather was wet and slight windy, and the skies were adorned with low-hanging clouds and sprinkling rain. Most people would choose to avoid hiking in that kind of weather, but that is exactly what I liked about it. The trail would often have no one on it, and I could have the woods to myself.

I began suiting myself up: a warm felt fedora, my water-resistant Columbia jacket, and my trusty Keen boots. Normally I would have taken my Camelbak backpack, which included a reservoir full of water, my survival kit, a knife, a Life-Straw, and some protein bars. But I didn't see the need for it. I was only going up the trail to the first lookout and then back down. I wouldn't need it, and I didn't care to add the extra weight.

The car beeped behind me as I squeezed the key fob and made my way to the trailhead.

Then, with my questions in tow, I stepped onto the trail and past the simple sign that read, "Table Rock."

</div>

<div class="section" id="setting-off">

## Setting Off

The trailhead began, deceptively enough, amidst the Ponderosa Pines and fern-covered floors of the Robert Louis Stevenson State Park. The small oasis stood in stark contrast to the typical Northern California landscape.

Nor-Cal was a wilderness mixed with equal parts stony mountain, and grass-covered rolling hills. The land, dotted largely with oak trees and manzanita brush, was an ecosystem built tough, to survive the heat of the sweltering summers and to endure the threat of long droughts.

It was a picture far removed from the California I had imagined, growing up in Montana. In my mind, the entire state was comprised of crowded beaches, desolate deserts, streets lined with palm trees and, of course, Hollywood.

In truth, I wasn't far off. But that TV portrayal was largely a reflection of Southern California. In particular, the Los Angeles area.

My hike started in a land all its own. The park, named after the author who had lived in the woods there long ago, was a different world altogether, almost literally.

The dense green forest was a micro-climate---a small area where the weather conditions made it completely different than everything else around it.

It was as if someone had cut out a parcel of land from a Northwestern US forest and planted it directly in the middle of the dry rock of the Nor-Cal wilderness.

That is exactly why I liked it.

The small bit of heaven reminded me of the forests of my home, in the northern mountains of the American West.

I grew up deep in the heart of the Rocky Mountains of Montana. It was a land still rutted with the trails of hopeful pioneers, carrying their families and dreams in covered wagons. It was a refuge of wide open spaces, of rugged mountain peaks and raging rivers.

** Gone are the days where we could pioneer. For there were now no more lands to conquer.Alexander (The Great) saw the breadth of his domain he wept, for there were no more worlds to conquer.

Those were my stomping grounds---a land of untouched wilderness, where we as children could cast our eager lines on its lonely rivers, and smell the sweet summer perfume of the ponderosa pines hanging thick in the air.

It was an ancient land, far removed from our world of plastic and powerlines. There amidst its unpretending truth, my father taught us how to survive, to care for it and to fear it.

Nor-Cal had a beauty all its own, but the often arid landscape tended to leave me hankering for the wooded forests of my youth.

So the beginning of the Table Rock trail was a welcome change.

I had been on this trail once before, so I knew it would be nice and green all the way to the lookout where I had stopped last time. Up there sat a beautiful spot to rest and think while looking out over the valley floor below.

Typically I made it my practice, when beginning my hike, to center myself, and at times even pray. This was one of those times when I needed the latter.

So as I launched out on the trail, I turned my gaze up to the sky above and began, "God, I going to need to ask some tough questions. I'm not even sure what I believe anymore, and I'm a minister. So how in the world can I know what my message is and what I should be doing? I need some clarity and some vision of how I can be useful."

It was simple, but I spoke every word with the fullest measure of honesty. Little did I know, every word of it would be answered with the fullest measure of truth.

</div>

<div class="section" id="gentle">

## A Gentle Start

Along the first half-mile of the trail, it was easygoing. A well-groomed stroll through a moist mossy forest.

I took my time, as I always did. Few things annoyed me more than being pressured to get to the end in record time. For me, it was the journey, not the destination that held the greater interest.

The dense old-growth forest around me, teamed with a thousand spectacular creatures, all dancing to the music of an ever-changing song. It was beautiful, wonderous, complex, and fragile.

I walked along the trail, thoroughly mesmerized, taking in every sight, sound, smell, touch, and---if I was lucky enough to find some wild berries---taste.

Every area of my mind was filled, leaving little room for anything else. All the weighty worries of the world that had been spinning around in my head, fell to the wayside, now replaced with the wonderous world around me.

I loved the outdoors, in whatever form I found it, for that very reason. It was in that space that I often found my greatest moments of inspiration, where I could allow my intuition and most basic self a clean slate to build upon.

Before long, I found myself approaching the clearing.

I hadn't expected to reach it so quickly, but I was glad to have arrived regardless.

The lookout was one of the early payoffs along the trail, though I had yet to venture beyond it to discover what else the trail had to offer. Along the right side of the trail, the trees parted, revealing a sharp sloping hillside, covered in a plush carpet of green grass.

The view was beautiful, exposing 180° of valley vista below. It was the perfect spot to sit and contemplate the meaning of life.

That is, except for today.

The gift of a dreary day, came hand-in-hand with the diminished chance to see anything too far away. The misty rain was harmless enough, but it also made it difficult to see much in the way of a view.

Even so, I stepped off the trail a short distance and sat myself down in the grass of the sloping hillside, attempting to admire what vista I was afforded.

In truth, it was a bit disappointing. I drove nearly an hour to get there and now, all I had was a hazy view of the valley below. I tried not to let it bother me.

Instead, I turned my attention to the reason I needed to come up there in the first place---the myriad of questions I had rolling around in my head.

</div>

<div class="section" id="strange">

## A Strange New World

Here I was, a lone human being, straight out of the modern world, now sitting in a world as it had been since the dawn of time.

I was a child born and raised in the old-world, thrown along with the rest of humanity, into a new and unfamiliar world. I was a Gen-X'er---the cross-over generation.

I began raised in the old-world ways -- hunting and fishing for food; confined to our cultures by land and sea, where people looked and acted much the same; seeing other cultures through the pictures and pages of the written word; speaking the same language as those around me; and largely uninterrupted by the impacts of distant cultures.

But that was yesterday. Today was the world of the internet.

Today the world was as different as different could be. We hunted and gathered in supermarkets, for food wrapped in plastic. We toured foreign lands and cultures with the swipe of a finger and click of a computer mouse. The languages of every tongue echoed off of our coffee shop walls.

The awkwardness and confusion from our conflicting cultures permeated every facet of our lives.

Who was I in this chaotic world? What did I have to offer that the world actually needed? Where could I bring the work that I loved, to meet the challenges of this new world?

</div>

<div class="section" id="turning">

## A Turning Point

The hard ground was beginning to make itself known. My now-numb backside needed some relief, so I stood up and stretched backward, hoping to get the blood flow moving again.

I had had my fill of the not-so-dramatic vista before me. There was only so much a person could enjoy a hazy view, pleasant as it may be.

I had two choices. (1) Turn around and start back home to the trailhead. Or (2) continue up the trail and give myself more time to think.

I had allowed myself some good reflection, but I had only touched the tip of the iceberg. I had some good ideas churching around in my head. If I headed back now, there wouldn't be enough time to process them.

I knew it was important. But was it important enough to warrant my hiking further up the trail? Was it important enough for me to set caution aside and to proceed unprepared up the mountain?

I stood there for a bit, first looking down the trail back home, then looking up the unfamiliar trail above. One was easy and well-defined. The other was a mystery, and a tempting curiousity.

I took one last look down the trail toward home.

Something inside me just couldn't do it. I couldn't simply return home. I couldn't go back to what was easy and familiar. But perhaps more than anything, I knew I couldn't go back again to a world where I remained directionless, without any vision, and absent of a clear sense of purpose.

I had to continue. I had to work this out and see it through to its end. I just had to, come hell or high water---both, as it turns out, were soon to come.

I turned to have one last look out over the misty valley below, pausing to take a good drink of water. Then, I swiveled around to face the path leading up to Table Rock, took a deep breath, and began to make my way up the trail.

</div>

<div class="section" id="labyrinth">

## The Labyrinth

In only a few minutes, I made my way over the crest of the first hill.

Before me, a world far removed from the lush forest stretched out in every direction, disappearing off into the mist. The now rocky trail marked a dramatic end to the comfortable path behind me.

What was once lush, green and wooded, had now become a barren landscape, resembling more of a desert than the forest I began with. The ground was transformed into barren rock, clay mud and scrub brush, revealing a more grueling testament to the raw nature of the Northern Californian mountains.

The path that was once straight and obvious had now morphed into a maze of off-shooting trails, surrounded by brush and crossing over the open rock face. Just up ahead, I could see the trail forking off a couple of different times.

It was never something a hiker wanted to see; diverging paths. It left one to second-guess themselves, and would of course mean that the way back might be equally confusing.

As I continued along the path, I found myself glacing often at the ground to determine my best choice of trail. I was happy to see that previous hikers had laid rocks or branches down to block off a number of the off-shoots that were dead-ends.

Before long, I noticed something interesting alongside the trail, off in the distance.

As I approached, I found a strange arrangement of rocks, laid out in a spiral, creating a circling path that led to the middle.

It was a labyrinth.

A chuckling snort escape through my nose as I considered the irony of it all. My life was a maze. This trail was a maze. And now...I could meander an actual maze while contemplating the first two.

I couldn't say for sure why previous hikers laid out the rock labyrinths, but I knew how they were often used in Churches.

Though I had practically been born on a pew, it wasn't until later in life that I was introduced to labyrinths. A number of different churches had them, usually taped off on a floor somewhere, but sometimes they were more intricate---some painted, some patched in with carpet or tile, and some set in stone or mosaics.

The idea behind the labyrinth was to provide a method for people to think and pray about whatever they needed to. People could begin at the start, and slowly make their way through while thinking about whatever it was they needed to consider.

Coming from a less formal church tradition, I had never encountered them, but I found the process fascinating. It made sense, especiall for an ADHD brain like mine. The pathway provided a sort of mental white noise to keep the mind from wandering while giving thought to whatever was needed.

Today, I welcomed the break from my hike and decided to take a little time to wander through the makeshift maze. In truth, I had plenty to occupy my mind, so the timing couldn't have been better.

I started on the outside path and slowly spiraled my way to the center.

As I plodded along, circling deeper and deeper into the center, I found myself narrowing my thoughts more and more. Eventually I discovered a couple of key questions to focus on:

> 1. Were there common rules that every person could agree to follow, regardless of our many differences?
>
> 2. Equally important, were there common issues that we could all agree to respectful disagree on?

It didn't take long to reach the middle. Like most productive thinking, I was left with more questions than I began with. But at the very least, I now knew which questions to ask.

I would have loved to continue circling in and out of the labyrinth, but I didn't know how long it would take me to reach Table Rock. So I decided to continue my thoughts as I made my way up the mountain.

As I crested over what appeared to be the last ridgeline, an immense ravine opened up in front of me, cutting a dramatic divide between myself and the mountain peak on the other side. I could see the trail zig-zagging its way across---down one side and up the other.

To my left, the ravine began at the top of the highest peak in the distance, cascading down with a sharp drop. To my right, it continued down beyond my line of sight, eventually plunging to the valley floor thousands of feet below.

Below me, the mountainside was covered with a sea of manzanita brush, stretching all the way down to where the creekbed cut through the bottom. The other side ascended upward with a steep pitch, composed almost entirely of sharp jagged rock.

The trail down my side of the ravine was relatively uneventful, though I did find myself taking the wrong trail at one point.

The other side, however, was slow going.

One thing that my father instilled in us at a young age, was how to set a good pace. Early on, I had a tendency to push myself unnecessarily. But my Dad wisely noted that retaining water in the wilderness was more important than getting somewhere in record time. So, when the hiking became more difficult, I would slow my pace. If the trail became steep, I would take shorter steps.

The lesson could have carried over well into my personal and professional life. Had I done so, I probably would have saved myself a heck of a lot of misery. But some lessons have to be learned the hard way.

I took my time, making my way up the other side carefully, watching my feet, and keeping an eye on the trail.

</div>

<div class="section" id="arrival">

## The Arrival

I was glad to see the sign for Table Rock.

Actually, I was relieved.

This trail had stretched out much further than I thought it would. I hadn't come prepared, so I was growing more and more concerned with each step.

Looking back over the distance I had covered, I found myself feeling a sense of pride wash over me. It had been a while since I'd been on a long hike. So it was reassuring to see that I could still handle something more challenging, even if it was last minute.

As I stood there catching my breath, a small drop of rainwater gathered off the front rim of my hat. As it grew, little by little, I found myself caught up in its simple struggle, hanging onto the edge as gravity continued its constant pull. Iit clunge on, helpless to remain, but hesitant to let go.

Without warning a slight breeze decided to finish the job for gravity, causing the desparate drop to finally fall. Down it went, plummiting the great distance, till at last it fell onto the rocky ground beneath me.

The once valiant drop dissapeared now into a gathering stream. It had lived its life, as much as a drop could. But in truth, it wasn't really gone. It was simply water and had always been, through and through.

I smiled to myself.

It seemed like a strange event to focus on, but that is what my hikes were for.

There, hidden away from the many complications of the world I left behind, I could escape. On the trail, I could find some measure of peace. There I could be removed from it all, free to contemplate the world as it truly was.

Nature still told the story of the real world and our real human history. It was like walking into history itself, a place where we lived and survived for thousands of years. We hunted for our food, gathered its fruit in season, fished in its streams, and warmed ourselves by its fire.

I looked at the sign once more, noting the trail beyond that would lead me up to the top.

The sprinkling rain sketched a scene of small trickling waterfalls, weeping down the face of the rock. Enshrouded in an eerie mystic mist, the trail felt other-worldly, like the entrance to some sacred elven shrine.

The large white letters stood out against the brown metal background like a warning---a side-of-the-road sign that read "Last Chance For Gas!”.

I took another deep breath, hoisted up my pants and cinched my belt. I shook the rain off of me, and started up the steep side of the rock, to the top of Table Rock.
