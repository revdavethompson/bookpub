# Becoming Achievable

> a\*chiev\*able
>
> 1. capable of being brought to a successful end
> 2. able to bring about an intended result

The storm picked up again, howling over the ridgeline, dumping down great buckets of rain. It poured off my hat like a waterfall cascading down on my boots below. It drummed out an insidious rhythm---the storm's version of a water-torture device---driving me further and further from my sanity.

It was the kind of other-planetary rain that Ray Bradbury describes in The Long Rain---a group of men who land on a planet of perpetual rain. As they search for a warming shelter, the unceasing downpour pushes them toward insanity. One by one they give themselves over to it, lifting their mouths open to the sky to be drowned.

It was required reading in high-school English that I never entirely understood.

But now I did.

A text from home pulled me back. "Have you heard anything? Any update?"

*Thank God! I needed the distraction.*

"No," I replied.

The response came quick. "Stay where you are. I'll try to get an update,".

I had, up till that point, resisted the overwhelming compulsion to share everything I could; every pain, every fear, and every worry. I thought if only I could share it all with someone, maybe it would make it more tolerable. Being alone was torture in and of itself.

I couldn't help myself. I wrote up a short text and hit send.

"I'mI'mI'm so cold."

I thought it would make me feel better. But it didn't.

Instead, I felt sick to my stomach. I had just injected my own peril and fear onto a person who was utterly undeserving of it. I was putting someone I cared so deeply for through absolute hell.

In truth, I desperately wanted to text, *I'm terrified, babe! The hypothermia is advancing too fast. I'm out of time, and I'm scared to die*.

But I couldn't allow myself to do it. It seemed somehow selfish to me.

I couldn't bear to push all of my terror and chaos onto my spouse. It would only serve to overwhelm two people rather than just one. What good would that do?

This was my fault.

I'm the one who took the hike. I'm the one who decided to take a stupid risk.

</div>

<div class="section" id="never">

## Now or Never

I sat there in a fetal position, clutching my legs into my chest as best I could, attempting to conserve as much body heat as possible while I waited for an update.

"Ding." The sound was music to my ears.

Clicking on the power button, I hurried to open my text app again. This time, however, something broke my focus. It was the time. Whether I wanted to acknowledge it or not, I was running out of time. In only one hour, the sun would begin to drop below the horizon, and with it, the light and the temperature.

Another icon caught my attention. Just to the left of the time, my battery indicator revealed yet another complication. Somehow, my battery had dropped to three percent.

Even before reading the new text, I fired off a quick note, worried the power would go out, "Phone dying. I love you." I wondered if it would be my last...ever.

I read the new text. "They just told me that they are on scene and search and rescue has started."

The air of optimism in the text was touching, and I could hear the joy and relief in those words.

But neither relief nor joy hit me. Instead, the words landed a monumental blow, knocking the wind of hope right out of me.

The world around me began to spin, swirling around and around, pulling me into the spiraling gravity of a terrible and unwelcome truth. It would be almost impossible for me to survive long enough for the rangers to reach me.

I would need to choose now, either to stay or to try and find my way off of Table Rock.

Gathering together all of the particulars in my mind, I measured out the inescapable truths around me.

> 1. The Rangers had only now started hiking.
> 2. It would take them upto two hours to reach the rock, let alone find me.
> 3. The sun would set long before they arrived.
> 4. After sunset, the temperature would drop to the mid-thirties.
> 5. With windchill and rain, it would feel like the mid-twenties.
> 6. I would lose body temperature rapidly, and it was already dangerously low.

They all pointed to only one inescapable conclusion. If I stayed here, I would die.

I had no choice but to hike off of Table Rock, and now.

But how on earth was I going to do that?!

I could barely stay awake! How could I muster up the strength to cross the rock again, directly into the wind and rain, let alone find my way off? And what about after I made it off? Would I even be able to walk down the steep rocky trail?

The magnitude of it all was overwhelming. I had never really been one to back down from a fight, but I simply didn't possess the strength required to pull it off. It was too much. Just, too much.

For the first time ever in my life, I felt something alien within me; something dark.

Beaten down now and crumpled up against that rock ridge, with every muscle and sinew twisted and wrung-out: life...seemed the lesser choice.

Like the men in The Long Rain, I wanted to be done with it all. Why should I go on?

All I would have to do was pull my hat off, lean my head back, open my mouth wide, and finally fall into that deep rest. It would be so easy. This could all be over.

In the end, I had no regrets. I had lived my life to its fullest. I had learned and loved and laughed and cried as completely as I could.

As I lay there under the downpour of drenching rain, something changed inside me. Before, I couldn't even imagine giving up a single second of possible life. But now? Now I no longer feared death. Instead, death felt like a kind of completion, like the closing of a final scene from a well-loved movie, just before the screen faded to black.

It would be...so...simple......

"Ding"

The text alert jolted me out of my grim thoughts, pulling me back from the precipice, where I was dangling.

Three familiar words appeared on my screen. I had heard them a thousand times before, but they never meant so much to me.

"Love you too. I'll be waiting at the trailhead for you with warm clothes."

They were the words I needed to hear. I needed to be reminded that it was about more than just me. I couldn't bear the thought of all the grief and pain it would cause if I were to give up. I couldn't stand to hurt the ones I loved if I had even a remote chance to survive.

Grasping ahold of the vision with everything in me, I resolved then and there that I would once again see my loved ones.

I snapped back into focus and turned my attention to the one remaining obstacle I had to consider.

If I left, the rangers would no longer know where I was. They were expecting me to stay at the location I shared with them.

Every book and every lecture about survival came echoing back. All of them cemented at least one core commandment into the psyche of every would-be survivalist: Thou shalt not move.

The rule was clear. If I was lost, I needed to let Search & Rescue come to me.

The Sheriff said, "don't move."

The Rangers said, "don't move."

Even my spouse said, "don't move."

But they were all missing a large portion of the equation. They didn't know the ruthless reality of my situation. They wanted my safety, as did I. But the rules they were asking me to follow, in my current context, would lead me to certain death.

They couldn't feel my numb arms and legs. They couldn't observe my confusion or hallucinations. They couldn't feel the absolute exhaustion of every part of me, pulling me relentlessly into a deep sleep.

I would have to decide for myself. Which choice was achievable for *me*?

It wasn't the first time in my life I had to make a survival decision that went against the rules I was taught. I had been placed in this position before. But back then, I was a wide-eyed naive man in my twenties.

Back then, I made the wrong choice...I chose to follow the rules as they were given.

It nearly destroyed my life.

## A Different Kind of Storm

The pungent tinge of bleach hung heavy in the air of the stark seminary cafeteria. The smell permeated the room, leaving little opportunity to enjoy any pleasant flavors or aromas.

The New England school lay an hour north of Boston, sitting atop the highest hill. Like some feudal cathedral out of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the hundred-year-old institution stood tall; a beacon and testament of truth.

Clustered on the far side of the cafeteria, my fellow ministry students and I sat around our rectangular dining table, deep in discussion. As was customary, we were well into our deliberation about the latest four-syllable words we had learned.

I pretended to listen, but I was miles away.

An invisible bubble encircled me, filled with a dense foggy haze. Outside the plastic barrier, the world continued along in steady fashion. Inside, however, a storm of cataclysmic force was raging all around me.

They had no idea what was going on or the terrible truth of what had happened.

Inside my world, I had already been crushed to pieces, smashed down into the rocky ground beneath me; over-worked, over-studied, over-committed, and overwhelmed.

I had pushed myself far beyond what I could realistically achieve. Though I thought I was invincible, what I didn't realize, was that every human being had limits. I was no different.

That was a lesson I was about to learn.

Ambitious as I was, I quickly found myself running the seminary's distance education program, working fifty-hour weeks as a "part-time" employee. I was, of course, a full-time graduate student with all that entailed, taking an additional class an hour away at Harvard Divinity School because, hey, why not? Not to mention, I was rehearsing a band and leading two church worship services on Sundays. On the off-chance I found some downtime, I would seek opportunities to speak at churches, or wherever someone would have me.

It was too much, but I didn't care. In my mind, I imagined I had a sizable stress management dam with a reservoir large enough to keep it restrained from causing any tragic flooding below. Sure there were a number of stress-rivers flowing in, but I figured I had plenty of room to manage it all.

What I didn't know, and couldn't see, was a destructive force residing underneath it all.

Deep under that mass of work, studies, music and ambition, something dark was looming. A long-ignored underground had been building up pressure for years, ready to burst open, and unleash a torrent of tribulation.

I thought I had it well under control. I was wrong.

Little did I know the utter devastation it was about to unleash.

</div>

<div class="section" id="blow">

## A Shocking Blow

Two months earlier, while working late in my office, I received a phone call from home.

My parents had recently returned home after a handful of years, of serving as medical missionaries in third-world nations around the globe. Now, they were settled in Tacoma, Washington, on the other side of the country from me.

It wasn't unusual for them to call, so per usual, we talked for a few minutes about the weather and other sundry things. In typical fashion, I caught them up on my work, my schooling and the church I was working with.

I finished talking about everything of interest on my end. So, of course, I turned the call back over to them, asking them what was new on their side of the continent.

A silent pause held the line, for a peculiar amount of time.

My father began, "We need to share something with you, David." His voice had changed. I knew this was serious. Usually, he called me Butch---his nickname for me---in casual conversation. He only called me David when it was something important.

"Candy?" He referred the call over to my mother, calling her by the name she went by socially---it was a nickname he gave her back in college, due to her partiality for sweet things, an inclination I happily inherited.

I knew what followed was going to be hard to hear.

My mother, who had never shied away from any conversation, began speaking with a soft and subdued tone. She cleared her throat and paused for a moment. Then she proceeded to tell me that she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. It had already metastasized, and she might only have a couple of years before it took her life.

The news of it came as a shocking blow.

No one ever expects a loved one to deliver a message like that. It was crushing to hear. I couldn't imagine how awful it must have been for her to have to tell each of us kids.

We finished the call with a generous helping of love, encouragement and support for one another. My family had always been very close, for which I was and am exceedingly grateful.

I hung up the phone, completely shaken. Without even thinking, I walked over and turned off the office light. Returning to my chair, I shut off my computer and sat in the dark and silence for nearly an hour.

I was completely numb inside. All of the many stresses and pressure of life that I was worried about, fell away. In their place sat the enormity of something I had never expected.
***
This was no mere stream of stress or river of responsibility. This was something else altogether. This was a hammer strike to my very foundation, a sudden and direct blow to the dam itself.

Normally a hit like this, though needing to be repaired, could be managed without catastrophic damage.

But my lake was already bursting at the seams.

My dam---my mind---now had a hairline fracture, and that's all that was needed to bring it crumbling down.

It was at that point that my world began to unravel around me. All of the many responsibilities that I was barely keeping up with, were now falling behind, as I struggled to focus. The more I fell behind, the more I became buried.

In the short time of a few months, I began to see the handwriting on the wall. I knew I would be unable to complete my school work, or catch up with my work. I was sinking further and further into irreparable damage.

Now unable to find any escape from the mar of wreckage around me, I fell into a deep sense of hopelessness. That hopelessness would lead me to a course of action that would teach me the hardest lesson I had ever had to learn.

</div>

<div class="section" id="strolled">

## In They Strolled

Back in the cafeteria, I fixed a vacant stare at the fried chicken on my plate. I wondered whether the unfortunate bird had ever realized its fate. Had it been given some warning, would it have tried to escape?

A smirk spread across my face with the thought of the helpless chicken fleeing the coop. In some strange way, it was comforting to me---birds of a feather, I suppose.

As I sat pondering the plight of my chicken, I noticed something unusual out of the corner of my eye.

Two seminary security guards, walking side-by-side, made their way through the cafeteria doors. Their light blue standard-issue uniforms made them nearly camouflaged against the cinder-block walls, painted with the same color. Behind them followed two blue-clad local police officers, their arms held in a cautious position.

Continuing in a straight line, they parted the room, walking down the middle in a steady rhythm to some drummed-out cadence only they could hear.

Eventually, they made their way to the back of the room, where most of us were sitting.

I pretended not to see them and instead proceeded to nervously stab at my salad, watching them out of the corner of my eye.

The students around me seemed to be shrugging it off as some random security training procedure. They didn't seem worried at all.

Why would they? It was a seminary.

But they didn't know.

I did.

The blue battalion made their way closer and closer until, at last, they came up to my table, turned at a right angle, and walked directly up behind me.

"David Andrew Thompson?" The security guard bellowed, using as foreboding a voice as he could muster.

"Yes, sir. That's me." I replied without hesitation. I wanted to get this over with.

"Could you come with us?" One of the officers, held out his arm, directing me to follow them.

"Of course." It wouldn't do any good for me to be difficult. I knew why they were there.

I picked up my backpack, handed it to the security guard, and slowly followed them out of the cafeteria, the two seminary security guards in tow.

They led me down the oversized hallway toward the front entrance, finally approaching the seminary's massive set of wooden doors. They were the kind of medieval cathedral doors I pictured when I thought of Martin Luther, nailing up his written condemnation of the Church for all to see.

The front door opened with a heaving groan, emptying out onto a small parking lot that sat directly on the other side of the cafeteria wall. The only thing now standing between my fellow ministerial peers and me was the cafeteria's brick wall, with its giant gothic windows.

They could see everything, and they did.

"Mr. Thompson, can you please place your hands on the hood of the car?" The officer commanded.

I did as he said.

The other officer began explaining what they would be doing---placing me in handcuffs for my "own protection."

The first officer began to frisk me while the other pulled out a small laminated card and read it aloud. "David Andrew Thompson, we are placing you under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say..."

The words I had heard on every tv cop series, were now being spoken to me in a steady metered flow. But for me, they were muffled and distant. I was busy sinking into the full realization of what was happening and what I had done.

Like some sort of out-of-body experience, I found myself hovering nearby, watching in the distance, with utter confusion and astonishment.

Looking down at this seminary man in handcuffs, the only thing I could manage to ask was, "Who is he?"

He looked nothing like the man he knew himself to be.

The man I knew had dedicated his life to living as morally as humanly possible. The closest he had come to committing a crime was stealing a tootsie roll from the grocery store. His father, of course, made him return it to the store manager (who kindly agreed not to turn the bawling boy into the police).

He never stole anything, ever again.

So what happened?

I'll tell you...the massive dammed-up reservoir of my stress and long-ignored needs had broken through and was now laying waste to everything and every part of who I was.

I wish I could say this was the worst of it.

But it wasn't.

It wasn't even close.

</div>

<div class="section" id="plan">

## An Unraveled Plan

A month or so earlier, after having learned about my mother, I found myself plummeting to my lowest and most desperate of moments.

I was finding it impossible to keep up with everything. No matter what I did, I simply couldn't catch up. With each new day, the backlog of todos became larger and larger.

I came to the point where the impossibility of it all hit me, and hit me hard. It became clear I would never catch up with my work, my studies, or all of the myriad of other duties I had heaped upon myself.

Completely burned out, I found myself unable to find the motivation to do anything at all. I didn't want to acknowledge it, but I knew I would have to throw in the towel.

All of my work, all of my studies, all of my career and calling...I had ruined it all, and it was now without repair.

I completely shut down.

I truly thought I could handle everything I had on my plate. Other people had similar stresses and equally difficult life events happening to them. How was I being crushed under it all, when others weren't?

I wouldn't come to truly understand this till later in life, but there was something that had been killing me slowly, from the inside out. I had dismissed it as unimportant, and the cost of my calling. But what I couldn't see was that it was my most debilitating hindrance of all.

I...was...*alone*.

Though I was busy socially, and highly networked, I was still alone.

I considered myself fortunate to have such a close-knit family and incredible friends. I figured that would be enough.

It wasn't.

There was something I was desperately lacking and had been for some time. I thought I didn't need it, but as it turns out, I couldn't do without it.

I had no one to love and no one to love me. Not just to love, but to intimately love, to passionately love, to share my unreserved self and life with.

I was told and truly believed that there was no other option for me but to be unmarried. My circumstances required it. The Church required it, especially as a minister.

But, as I would come to learn, I did need it, and (with rare exception) so did every other human being.

I didn't realize it then, but that loneliness had slowly been poisoning me. My drive, my ambition, and the need for success were all there to distract me from what I needed most...love...intimate love.

</div>

<div class="section" id="desperate">

## A Desperate & Dangerous Decision

It was on a Sunday afternoon, that the toxic truth of my unachievable life took its most tragic toll.

Sitting at the desk of my seminary dorm room, I stared blankly at a DVD copy of the movie, A River Runs Through it. Over the last few weeks, I had watched it at least a dozen times. The stunning scenery of the Montana rivers and mountains gave me an intoxicating relief from the nightmare around me.

The idea of standing on those rocky banks of the Clark Fork River as I cast my fly-line felt like freedom, freedom from it all. I could almost smell the pungent perfume of the cottonwood trees on the breeze---it was one of the few scents that, to this day, can instantly transport me to a place of peace and calm.

The notion of freedom from it all, of escape, enraptured me, compelling me to action.

I pulled out a notebook and a pen. A frenzied and mad plan took shape.

Everything I had built and worked so hard for was now falling into ruins. In my tattered state of mind, I saw no hope for salvation. So what was the point?

If I had destroyed my life already, I might as well leave it all behind.

I glanced again at the DVD cover in front of me, admiring the picture of its misty restful river. I could think of no more glorious place to escape to than the wilderness of my youth. There under the Big Sky, I could genuinely check out. Far from everything, I could live off the grid and just disappear into the wilderness that I loved.

It was desperate, unhinged, reckless, and rash. But at that point, I just didn't care anymore.

I took my pen and notepad and constructed a plan, slowly laying out the various details:

> 1. I would drive cross-country to Seattle to say goodbye to my family and, most importantly, to see my mother before the cancer took her. When I left, I would tell them I was driving back to the seminary.
> 2. But in truth, I wasn't going back. Instead I planned tod stop in Montana and head north to the wilderness of the northern Rockies.
> 3. First I would need to purchase only the essential survival gear; a small tent, a survival guide, and a sleeping bag.
> 4. I would send the items to a place in North Dakota I knew well, where I knew they wouldn't ask questions. I didn't want to draw suspicion by receiving them locally.

But there was a problem. I didn't have enough money to pull it off.

I couldn't let that stop me.

There, in that hour of absolute desperation, I reached for the only immediate solution I could find.

In my position at the seminary, I had access to my department's student information.

Though to this day I still shudder at the thought of it, I decided to access the database and pull up a couple of credit card numbers. I used them to purchase the few supplies that I couldn't afford.

To this day it remains one of the most disappointing and appalling actions of my life.

I would later pay dearly for it, but I knew I deserved every bit of my punishment.

Over the next couple of weeks, I carried out my plan as best I could. I started on my drive across the United States, from shore to shore; Boston to Seattle.

At first, everything was going as planned. I had made it to North Dakota, where I would stop to pick up the items I purchased. Having been a student there previously, I knew the college wouldn't ask a lot of questions. so I stopped by and picked up my deliveries from the mailroom.

Next, I planned to continue on to Tacoma---in the Seattle area---to visit my parents.

But, there at that school where I first nurtured my calling, something happened that I hadn't planned or prepared for. I was met with a show-stopper.

Me.

The guilt of what I had done was too much to bear. I simply couldn't go through with it, as much as I tried.

Though I still wanted to return to Montana, I decided that for now I would go back to Boston and try to fix what I had done.

So the next day, I turned around and drove all the way back to Boston.

Unbeknownst to me, the police had already been alerted. So two days after I had returned, I found myself being arrested in front of the seminary cafeteria and its onlooking students.

</div>

<div class="section" id="flee">

## To Flee or Not To Flee

So there I was now, sitting in the local S. Hamilton police station, alone and in terror for what would come. The officer was speaking with someone, so I spent some time trying to calm down as much as possible. As noted, I wanted to take full responsibility for my actions. It wouldn't help if I were erratic and all over the place when they came to talk with me.

Throughout my life, I had spent quite a bit of time with officers. A few of them were family friends, people from church, or people I was there to help and listen to.

Never had I ever interacted with police from the other side of justice. So when the officer returned I quickly asked, "What's going to happen?".

The officer looked around, and then looked back at me, saying, "You're going to prison for life, or at least thirty years or so!"

Perhaps the officer enjoyed intimidating me, or he was simply having a bad day and wanted to take it out on someone. Either way, his reply was as far from the truth as possible and as devastating as possible.

My whole world came crashing down around me. *Thirty years?!*

It might as well have been a death sentence.

I was spiraling down, caught in the current of a whirlpool of desperation. All of my life's work and everything I had worked toward was now circling the drain along with me.

But none of that really mattered much to me at that time. Instead, the only thing I could think about was the fact that I would never see my mother again. She would die long before I ever had the chance to say goodbye.

They finally let me out on a twenty-five dollar bail, explaining that I couldn't leave the state without permission. I tried to explain that my mother had breast cancer and I needed to see her before I was sentenced.

The officer, without a beat, let out a sarcastic *pffft*, adding, "Good luck with that!"

With that I understood. I would have to drive across the country before my court date, even if I wasn't supposed to. There was no way that I was going to pass up the chance to see my family once more.

And so I did.

For the second time, I drove across the country to see my family once more. Thankfully, during that time I was able to talk with a lawyer who informed me that the officer was wrong about the sentencing. He explained that it was unlikely that a judge would recommend incarceration. The judge would likely go lenient in my case, this being my first infraction, and considering my state of mind and my life of ministry.

</div>

<div class="section" id="cost">

## Cost & Consequence

I was on my way back through Massachusetts for the second time, when I encountered the police again.

While driving through Worchester Country, on some side roads in the middle of the state, I had pulled off to nap for a short while.

An officer approached to check things out, asking me if I was ok. He took my license and registration and went back to run them in his system. It was no surprise to me that he came back noting I was on bail.

He asked to search my car. Being naive I said yes. I noted that I had my hunting rifle in the trunk of my car, as I was still planning on returning to Montana. (The 270 Winchester was my grandfather's hunting rifle and then my dad's until eventually, it was then passed down to me.)

The officer was sympathetic, noting that he didn't want to arrest me, but explained there was a relatively new law requiring him to arrest me on the spot. The law required any person possessing a firearm, to register it with the state.

I tried to explain that being from Montana (where there were no restrictions) I had no idea.

He apologized, explaining that it was a hotly debated law, but that he had to do his job. I told him that I understood and would willingly comply.

I was eventually cleared of all charges. However, the divided law required that I be arrested under felony charges and immediately placed in Worchester County's maximum-security prison during the process. So that's where I stayed for a few weeks.

When I was finally released, I walked out that door with two things: tremendous respect for my freedom and a nickname, "Montana."

As for my original charges at the seminary, the court was gracious with me, noting that my actions were committed under extreme mental and emotional distress. They were kind enough to consider my lack of past infractions and my many years of service to others.

In the end, they found me *not guilty*, pending full restitution to my victims and successful completion of two years of counseling, and adherence to the other requirements of the court.

After it was all said and done, I finally understood something critical about myself, and more importantly, something fundamental about being a human being.

There was a fundamental rule that I could no longer ignore. To borrow from the Bible's first recorded moral law, *it is not good for man to be alone*.

I needed love, intimate love. To deny myself this most essential human need was simply not achievable.

To live a healthy and achievable life, I had to leave behind, all the requirements, the people, and the beliefs that had led me down that dark path. Instead, I chose the path that I knew I could achieve. I needed to survive and to intimately love.

So that is exactly what I did.

</div>

<div class="section" id="rock">

## The Rock and A Hard Place

Now, sitting against the ridgeline, under the storming tempest, I had to make yet another difficult choice to survive.

I knew the rules. I was supposed to stay and let the rangers come to me. But once again, I had to choose an achievable path, the path where I could survive.

I chose to hike off the rock.

Now I just needed to do it.

It was easier said than done. Every fiber of my being was screaming for rest. But I couldn't. I had to move, and now.

I can't recall another moment when my spirit was so willing, but my flesh was so weak. I had never had to work so hard to will my body into action.

How was I going to do it?

I had no idea, but that didn't matter. The only thing that mattered was surviving, which meant there was no question at all. I had no choice but to make it happen.

I knew it would be too overwhelming to think of everything all at once. I had to start small.

My mind drifted to the movie *What About Bob?* The book title of Bill Murray's character rolled into my imagination. *Baby Steps*. That was all I needed to think about.

I resolved to focus only on the most minor efforts I could. First, I needed to stand.

I broke it down further. I shouldn't think about standing; I should think about leaning forward.

I tried to lean forward, but my body refused. I felt like that frustrated parent in the grocery store, trying to force their unruly kid to stand, as he hung lifeless, playing *dead fish*.

But I was determined. I took a deep breath and unleashed as loud and forceful command as I could muster. "Come on! Lean forward! LEAN FORWARD!!!"

I felt my stomach tighten as my back began to slowly lift and finally pull itself in close to my knees.

Ok. One baby step taken.

Next, I needed to put my hands on the rock wall behind me to leverage my weight while I stood.

The task, however simple, proved harder to actually accomplish. I lifted my arms slowly behind me, but I couldn't feel anything. I had to look back at each hand to confirm they were in a stable position.

It was time to stand up.

I rested there for a second and then took another deep breath, filling my lungs with the cold, wet air.

"Get up! Stand up, you #%&$@%$! COME ON!!!"

It helped.

I pressed my legs hard against the rock below my feet, bracing my arms against the rock behind me.

Inch by inch, I raised myself up, unsure whether any part of me would fail at any time.

Finally, I pushed off as hard as possible and found myself standing straight up on my legs...sort of.

Beneath me, my legs shook, unstable and uncertain. It was a minor victory, but I had zero time to pat myself on the back. I still needed to walk across the rock and somehow find my way down to the trail, and time was ticking.

I mustered another deep breath, shouting at myself again. It was surreal to be so disconnected from my own body, having to command it to do something so simple, like driving a stick-shift car after years of driving an automatic.

Slowly and deliberately I made my way across the rock, battling the roaring wind and pelting rain with every step, each one a small victory in itself.

Finally, I came to the pile of rock on the edge that I thought held the most promise for escape.

I looked out over it, following the side of the rock down as it sloped at a steep angle, disappearing into the mist only a few yards away.

Was this just another cliffside of the rock? If I climbed down and was wrong, would I slip and fall to my death? Would I even be able to pull myself back on top of the rock?

None of it mattered.

The sun would start its descent soon, and I had no choice.

I shouted at myself, "Just go, Dave! GO!!".

I began my climb down, grasping at each rock with numb, shaking arms, stepping on each stone with unsteady legs. Down the edge of the rock, I crept, with calculated caution, step by step.

Only a short way down, I attempted to take another step, but there was nothing to step on.

I lowered myself down a bit further, reaching out as far as possible with my leg. Still, there was nothing below me.

My heart began to race as I realized that I had chosen the wrong path.

I didn't have it in me to climb back up.

I gave the area around me a brief glance and saw that I could continue in that direction. So that's what I did.

I had no idea if I was going the right way, but I didn't have any other choice. I didn't have time for options. I kept going, climbing over, one step at a time.

Each chance I found to climb further down, I took it. One step after the other.

I knew I could be climbing to my death with every step. But I had to keep going.

I could see my arms beginning to shake. They were going to give out soon.

I didn't know how much further I could go.

I stretched my foot downward, searching for the next step. Finally, I felt something solid. But as I attempted to lower my leg to the next step below, it stopped. It stopped on the same level as my other foot.

I carefully tried to step further over to the left. Then further away from the rock.

It was solid. It was a ledge!

I lowered the full weight of my body and attempted to stand and slowly turn myself around. Leaning my back against the rock, I took the welcome opportunity to rest.

As I looked down at my feet, I noticed water rushing over them. I followed the stream with my eyes looking to find its source. It was coming down a part of the rock that was slowly rising back up toward the top.

I couldn't be sure, but I wondered. Was that the trail I took to the top of the rock?

Had I found it?!

Whatever the case, it was a walkable ledge. As far as I could recall, the only place where that was the case was the way on and off.

It was a welcome break. Even if it turned out to be a dead-end, I counted it another victory.

It helped.

I crossed the small stream to the other side of the ledge and began following the stream down. The rock was slippery now, so I had to proceed with caution, one step at a time.

The promise of making it off Table Rock fueled a new sense of optimism, driving me into a steadier pace.

As I continued down the slope, I saw something in the distance. The object started to take the shape of a small square. I tried my best not to get my hopes up, but I couldn't help it.

I found my pace quickening, driven by a compelling urge to know, for sure, what was ahead of me.

After a few more steps, clearing from the haze around me, it came into focus. It was a metal sign with words on it. I took a few more hurried steps.

The words on the sign read "Trail to Table Rock."

I didn't want to believe it at first. I couldn't.

I was sure I would be jolted awake from my fairytale dream, finding myself back in the center of the hellish storm yet again.

As soon as I reached it, I took hold of it with both hands. It was real. I couldn't feel it, but I knew it was real.

I had made it off of Table Rock!

It was a monumental triumph, but I couldn't stop to relish the victory. The sun was going down in roughly thirty minutes.

Yes, I was out of the worst of the storm, but I couldn't stop. If I did, I would be stopping for good.

I wanted to celebrate. I wanted to rest. But I knew that ahead of me lay three miles of rocky unmarked trail that was now gushing with water.

Before I started, I needed to send a text. The rangers needed to know I was no longer on the rock. I could only hope that my battery would still have power.

I clicked the phone on. It worked, but my reception was down to one bar.

I hurriedly opened my messages and wrote a simple text to my spouse, hitting send. "I found trail"

It went through.

I typed another message out, "Hiking trail out," and hit send again.

The text hovered with a pending status. I waited...and waited.

For whatever reason, I couldn't get enough reception.

I looked down again, praying that the text would finally go through.

The screen flickered. Then it went black.

Now...I was truly on my own.
