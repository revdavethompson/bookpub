# Another End, Another Beginning

I shook the pooling rainwater off the brim of my felt hat, scattering the water in every direction.

The moment conjured up the memory of a favorite childhood water toy, the Willy Waterbug Sprinkler. It was famous in the hot summers for randomly shooting water in every direction. I use the word *toy* loosely. The verdict between *toy* or *torture device* largely depended on whether one was jumping over its whipping tentacles, or just enjoying the spray from a safe distance.

A smile stretched across my face and I allowed myself to chuckle for the first time since the storm hit. Now that the worst was behind me, it was a welcome change to enjoy a pleasant memory and emotion. Humor certainly came easier without terror breathing down its neck.

## How Bright the Light

The trail was becoming wider now, a sign that there wasn't much further to go.

I looked around me, more grateful than I had ever been to find myself surrounded by others, proving the old axiom, *the more the merrier*.

The ranger's flashlights reflected off of their slick-wet ponchos, shooting rays of light in every direction, piercing the darkness around us. The jagged shadows of fern leaves and pine needle branches danced against the black curtain of night.

I had never before appreciated just how powerful a single ray of light could be. When every color of the spectrum came together, it could render even the darkest of nights powerless.

Even in my darkest hour, when the world around me seemed lost, with no direction in sight, one little unspectacular flashlight gave me hope and a path to find safety again. It was an irony of the greatest kind; the light shines brightest in the darkest hour.

## To See A Storming World

As we continued down the trail, we soon came upon the vista point where, on my way up, I had initially planned to stop.

I turned to one of the rangers and asked, "Do you mind if we rest here for a moment?".

"Of course," he replied, grabbing the attention of the other rangers.

They offered me another energy bar and some water.

I welcomed both.

After a couple of minutes of eating, drinking and resting, I nudged the ranger next to me, saying. "This is where I originally intended to stop this morning. It's usually such a beautiful lookout point. Obviously, it wasn't today."

"Mind if ask why you decided to continue?"

I stopped to think for a second, then replied, "I wasn't done brooding yet. I still had too much to chew on."

One of the rangers burst out with an unintended "Ha!". Slightly embarrassed, he quickly clarified, "I completely get that. That's where I do my best thinking. On the trail."

Another chimed in, "Yep. That and fishing." He smiled.

The third ranger decided instead to ask another question, "So did you get any answers?"

I didn't even hesitate. Looking him dead in the eyes, I replied, "You have no idea."

He nodded, "I don't doubt it."

As I rested for another brief moment, I thought back to that watershed moment, when I chose to continue up the trail to Table Rock.

It had only been a few hours before, but somehow it felt like a lifetime ago. So much had happened in so little time.

But now, reaching back to that moment, I was reminded of the reason for my hike and the world that had driven me to go off in search of inspiration and purpose.

It was a tumultuous time to be alive.

We were a world of ancient humans, fresh from the mouths of our wooded cabins and caves, being thrust into an unfamiliar and alien modern world. Like toddlers placed in the driver's seat of a Mac Truck, we were wreaking havoc with powers that we could neither fully comprehend, nor operate without catastrophe.

In just one generation, we had come uncomfortably close to the magic of our gods.

* We were becoming omnipresent; able to be everywhere at once. We could speak to every human being, everywhere around the planet, at the same time.

* We were becoming omniscient; able to know everything. We had the accumulated sum of human history and knowledge literally at our fingertips---all of its beauty and all of its ugliness.

* We were becoming omnipotent; possessing godlike powers. We could heal the sick,  fly through the air, look into the expanse of the universe, go into the very heavens where the gods were from, visit distant planets, and now possessed the ability to wipe humanity from the face of the earth in the blink of an eye.

How, in the name of God, did we think we had any idea how to manage this power? Never before in our human history have we faced these kinds of success problems.

We were still trying to adhere to our ancient rules, instead of the timeless principles they were built on. Those rules worked at one time when our world was divided by great expanses of oceans and land. Instead, they were now wreaking havoc.

## A Quick Thank You

I nudged one of the rangers in the side, noting that I was ready to go on. He stood up and again offered to help me stand. I was fairly well recovered now, but I took his hand anyway.

We meandered back over to the trail, getting organized to hike the rest of the short distance between there and the trailhead.

Before we set off, I waved my hand to get their attention. It dawned on me that I had yet to say thank you to these wonderful people. So I took the opportunity to do so before we were lost in the commotion of the team below.

"Gentlemen, I can't even begin to thank you. I'm at a loss for words. You saved my life tonight and I will forever be in your debt." I said.

They expressed their appreciation for the gesture.

We set off down the trail once again, towards the trailhead below and the end of my journey.

## Back to Humanity & Home

It was still hard to accept that I was only a short distance from my final escape and my return to the world. Still, in a daze, my mind could think of nothing but the warm clothes, a warm hug, and our car heater below.

I had learned so much on the top of that mountain---perhaps more than I cared to. Now I was returning to the world I had only recently stepped away from. But in that short time, up on that mountaintop, I was relieved of all of my many distractions. Now, I was returning, not as a different person, only a simpler one---A human.

As I walked along the woody path, I thought I saw something flicker in the distance, through the trees. We continued walking for a bit. Again, another light could be seen shining through. The further we walked, the more lights began to shine through the needled pines.

We were finally arriving at the trailhead.

Only a short distance further down the trail, I saw it. A large wooden sign stood out against the ferns. On its face were carved the words, *Table Rock*.

It was the trailhead.

One of the rangers shouted out to me, "We're Here!"

As I took the final step off the trail and onto the parking area, I could feel the heaving weight of the panic and fear lifting off of me.

What was left?

A mere human being remained, absent of his fragile foundation and the complex structures that it held up. Those were all leveled to the ground. In their place lay a solid bedrock of undeniable truth. It may not have been much, but at least I knew I would be building my house on solid ground.

The medical team was the first to approach me, assessing my condition and covering me in a warm wool blanket. They checked my vitals, finding that my body temperature was still low, but had likely improved from hiking.

Next, the local Sheriff who had been texting me came up and placed his arm on my shoulder, saying, "Welcome back, Dave! Somebody is waiting for you."

He directed me around to my right. Standing there before me was my spouse of eight years, with a huge smile and a stack of warm clothes to put on.

I slowly staggered over and fell into a much-needed embrace.

The sheriff began walking away, saying, "I'll leave you two alone."

"First things first, we need to get you out of those wet clothes!" I was hardly going to protest.

I could have cared less that a dozen or so people were standing around as I carefully took everything off and slowly put the dry clothes on. I was still unable to use my fingers much, so I had to rely on some help.

I thanked everybody who had come to help retrieve me from the storm on the mountain, offering my apologies for making the poor choices that involved them in the first place.

We climbed into the car. Turning the heat on high, we redirected all of the vents to blow on me.

We pulled out of the parking lot and onto the road home.

As the mountain faded away, into the distance, the enormity of everything that had transpired in those few short hours, hit me. For the first time since I was trapped in the storm, I could breathe a sigh of relief.

All the terror, pain and panic fell away.

There was nothing left for me to fear.

My loving spouse was driving us home.

Finally, I let go...and cried.
