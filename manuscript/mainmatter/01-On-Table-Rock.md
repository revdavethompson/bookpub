# On Table Rock

"Table Rock"

The words made sense now. A massive slab of rock lay out in front of me, like a colossal table made for the gods, protruding straight out from the mountaintop.

It was impressive, putting it mildly.

Nature, I found, was without equal in its design; unmatched among the applauded architects of our world. It was for this very reason that I loved to find myself in the outdoors, and often. There I could remember the beauty only found in the unplanned. Nature may have created a million overlooked oddities, but every now and then, its hammer and chisel struck an exquisite form.

Chills ran up the back of my spine, whether by the drop in temperature or by the sheer awe of the monolith in front of me.

The stone floor was a tricky combination of sharp and smooth. The ancient byproduct of cooled liquid magma had slowly broken off over thousands of years to reveal its jagged sharp corners and perilous cliffs.

The fog and sprinkling rain decorated the rock like a set out of some supernatural horror film. Pools of water gathered in the cracks and crevices scattered across the rock, creating a hundred mirrors, amplifying the dark contrasting grays against the ghostly white mist and clouds above them.

Before me stretched a football field of stone, surrounded on three sides by perilous cliffs dropping down hundreds of feet to the rocks beneath them. One wrong step and it would be the last.

I'll confess---I loved cliffs. I always had.

There was something about me that needed to stand as close to the edge as possible. Some deep-seated drive in me created an incessant need to get as close as possible to danger without actually being killed. Whether it was climbing to the very top of a tree, jumping boulders to get to the end of an ocean jetty, or standing at the cutting edge of a perilous cliff.

You could argue that it drove me into outright stupidity.

One case in point...

As a teenager, I made the brilliant decision to get as close to a bear as possible---it seemed fun at the time.

One Fall day, my brother, myself and a friend of ours spotted a lone bear, lumbering through the wooded ravine that ran behind our house. God only knows why I felt so compelled to get within spitting distance.

The whole ordeal was of course ratcheted up a notch when my brother and friend decided it would be hilarious to begin throwing rocks in the hapless bear's direction.

My mother, who somehow possessed the eyes of a hawk, saw me and the bear from our back-porch---a half-mile away. Naturally, she began screaming at me to get away from the bear---her voice somehow carrying over the long distance. I was busy yelling at my brother and friend who were in stitches, doubling over in laughter at the whole thing. The bear, who couldn't figure out what was happening, thankfully took off in the opposite direction.

Suffice it to say, I had a tendency to lean into risk. No doubt my parents did not find the adrenalin rush as appealing as I did.

It was likely something genetic and hardwired, carried down over the generations. Maybe it was the same disposition that drove my family to cross the Oregon Trail in covered wagons to Montana and Oregon. And before them, their ancestors who crossed the great Atlantic Ocean to the New World's early colonies, seeking a new life, and opportunity.

Regardless, it was a part of me that I found incredibly useful in my line of work. I was rarely deterred by the many risks and shortfalls that came with life.

But I would soon come to understand, that left unchecked, it could be devastating.

For now, having arrived at the top of Table Rock, I found myself excited. I knew that there was supposed to be an incredible view of the valley below. All I needed to do now was cross the rock to the lookout on the other side. I was anxious to make my way over. So I didn't waste any time. I set off toward the other side of the rock.

All the pictures I had seen of Table Rock, made the “Table” top of the rock seem like it was completely flat. But in reality, looking out ahead of me, I could see that I was sorely mistaken. The sharp rough stone created an erratic surface that was tricky to navigate. With every step, I had to make sure to keep one eye focused on the ground at all times. It would be easy to trip, and if I did, I would feel the full brunt of gravity’s force. No fall would be easy up here.

Now and then, I found myself crawling up and over rocks, ditches and small ravines. They were manageable, but the addition of the sprinkling rain made the already awkward rocks slippery and dangerous.

Before too long, I reached what I assumed to be the middle of the rock. I paused to take an inventory of where I was, and what the weather was doing.

Being on the top of a flat barren rock, I was far more exposed than I had been on the trail. I wasn't expecting anything crazy as far as the weather was concerned. But I was surprised to find that it was a fair bit colder up there.

My outfit was warm and versatile. It was my go-to when I wasn't sure what to expect. My hiking jacket was water-resistant, though not waterproof. The current mist and light wind were no problem for now. But any more than that and my jacket would begin to provide diminishing returns.

Generally, I preferred cooler hiking clothes when I was on the trail, even if it were a colder and wetter day. More often than not I preferred to go with a lighter jacket that could breathe more easily. Being a portly fellow of Scottish/German heritage, I tended to be a better fit for the wet highlands. So the mist and rain didn’t bother me that much.

There was something beautiful about the variety of rock formations all around me. I played a game with myself, attempting to determine what each of the larger rocks looked most like. Off to my left, I came upon a couple of larger rock formations that stood out from everything else around them. Like rough stone statues, hewn from the rock, the life-sized human figures took on the cautionary form of people huddled together against an invisible enemy.

I memorized them and made a mental note. They could serve as a good marker to orientate me if I were to get turned around up here.

Wanting to get to the other side with as much haste as possible, I continued on my way. I was happy to be comfortable at the moment, but I could notice the breeze increasing slightly with every few meters I added. I figured the wind would increase as I approached the cliffside lookout, but I was a bit surprised by the drop in temperature. Though I was warm enough, for now, I knew the cold wind would provide a chilling challenge to my light jacket. Once I had arrived at the edge and sat for a while, it wouldn't take long for my body to cool down. Any stronger wind would certainly turn up the chill factor, so I needed to be mindful of that.

After another ten or so minutes, I felt the wind pick up dramatically. It felt good. I had worked up a sweat from all the climbing around, and of course, from the previous hiking. So I unzipped my jacket and let the wind cool me off a bit. I figured the cliff wasn't far away, so I took some comfort in knowing that I would soon be able to sit and enjoy a rest while relishing the remarkable view.

Normally I would find myself picking up pace as I inched closer to my destination. But I had to be careful on this rock. The cliff edge wasn't exactly easy to make out. So each step needed to be deliberate.

Finally, a distant glimpse of the valley below began to come into sight.

I was giddy as a schoolboy.

After the demanding hike and challenge of crossing the rock, I was thrilled to finally reach the lookout.

It had been a long time since I completed a hike with such a payoff. So I found myself filling with excitement with each step closer toward the cliff's edge.

At long last, I arrived.

This time, meeting my journey's end gave me a profound sense of achievement and success. To now see again that I could push myself past my limits, gave me a feeling of strength and hope; hope that I could do more, and be more.

I looked out over the corner of the cliff edge, and down the dramatic drop to the rocks beneath it. Over the mounds and along the twists and turns, I traced the steep mountainside all the way to the valley floor below, disappearing off into the distance.

Seven-thousand feet lower, the vista sprawled out, stretching out as far as the eye could see. For miles in every direction, a magnificent mural was laid out in front of me. There before me stood a spectacular painted canvass, etched with distant mountain peaks, sweeping brush strokes of green and golden valleys, whispy rows of wine vineyards, and dotted with quaint country towns along its floor.

Beautiful as it was, there was something also ethereal about it. The clouded haze of the sprinkling rain made the painting appear as if it was delicately washed over with a feathered brush. There was something magical about it---and something foreboding.

Just to the right of me, a large pile of rock looked to provide a perfect spot to take a seat. I reached over and sat myself down, stretching my legs out, my feet resting just inches away from the cliff's edge.

I took in a tranquil breath and admired the work of art spread out before me; every color, every line, every depth, and every detail.

There were only a few places on earth where I could do my best thinking. On top of a mountain peak, was my ideal spot. The height gave me a distance of sorts from the everyday meanderings of society. Up here, the craziness of life around me seemed to be made smaller, reduced to its simplest forms; mountains, valleys, towns, people.

Being on a mountaintop was as close as I could get to seeing the world from God's perspective. I imagined a view from space would be even more incredible, but I doubted I would ever get the chance.

I could only imagine what it would be like to see our world from space, looking down on our planet as a whole. What a gift to view it from above, where the imagined importance of our many differences could be considered in the context of who we are together---one singular collection of human beings; one massive but fragile blue marble of life, longing for safety, trust, and love.

For now, I was more than content to admire the breathtaking view from my rock-pile recliner, on the cliff-edge lookout, here on Table Rock.

## Something Dark in the Distance

As I took in the view, I welcomed the opportunity to drink some water and rest. I needed it, especially after the long hike, and this was the perfect spot for it. So I repositioned myself a bit and leaned back against the rock behind me. It was pretty darn comfortable, as far as stone lounge chairs go. I felt my eyelids growing heavy, so I closed my eyes and savored the spattering sound of the rain around me...and dozed off.

It was a stiff breeze that finally jolted me awake, nearly knocking me off my seat. Instinctively, I threw my leg out to catch myself from tipping over. Being thrown off-balance while sitting near the edge of a two-hundred-foot cliff, shook away any remaining sleepiness I may have felt. Few things woke a person faster than a shot of adrenalin.

The wind was picking up, and fast.

I steadied myself, holding tightly to the rock and looked out over the cliffside. I looked down at the valley below, gazing across to the quaint town of Calistoga, a smaller community just a few miles from the base of the mountain.

It was one of my favorite towns to visit when I needed to get away for a day. The main street held a charming collection of coffee shops, bakeries, bookstores and a smattering of small and sundry galleries and storefronts.

The town was a favorite destination for many in the area. It had a sort of country-cottage feel which made for an appealing change from the hustle and bustle of the larger city life. One could easily spend the day perusing its numerous tourist-friendly stores.

As I gazed out over the town, just past the edge, something caught my eye. The once milky-white haze had turned to a darker shade. A charcoal-colored wall now stretched across the valley, from one side to the other. It charged forward, leaving a sinister shadow in its wake.

I was finding it difficult to see exactly what was causing it.

*A storm front, maybe?*

I stood up on my feet, silent and still as could be, focusing all my attention on the ominous dark storm below. In only a few seconds It had already begun to barrel into Calistoga.

In swift fashion, the blackened beast swept into the city, engulfing it block-by-block, like a great whale swallowing a school of fish.

I looked down at my phone, checking the time. If the weather was going to change, then I needed to head back. I pulled myself together and prepared to return to the other side of the rock---and I'd better hurry.

I took in one last view of the valley below. But this time, what I saw was frightening.

I couldn't believe it. The entire town had already been swallowed whole by the storm.

*Had it really moved that fast?!*

I froze for a moment, my mind attempting to make a quick assessment of the scene in front of me.

*It can’t be moving that fast!*

I could feel my heart beginning to beat harder in my chest as if it knew something I didn’t.

I looked around me, taking quick stock of the weather. Up here on the rock, not much had changed, except for the increasing wind.

Then I looked back down.

The foreboding black clouds had surged forward, billowing over the valley floor like a swelling ocean tsunami swallowing the land. Giant black waves rushed toward the foot of the mountain with considerable speed, crashing with a fury against the stony cliffs far below me.

To my horror, I watched, helpless, as the surging sea rushed up the mountainside, undeterred by its towering cliffs.

I felt a sudden gulping breath---the kind of involuntary reflex that happens when falling into freezing waters.

My body already realized what my mind had yet to concede.

"Oh my God!" I whispered under a trembling breath.

In that paralyzing moment, I understood. The storm was now coming for me.

I quickly snapped out of my stupor and hurried to calculate my options.

The answer came short and swift.

If I didn’t leave now and race to the other side, I would be trapped on top of this rock in a raging storm.

There was no time to lose.

I shot around on my heels and shifted into high gear toward the other side of the rock. This time it was no relaxing stroll. This time it was a race against time.

I had to get off the top of the rock. Otherwise, I would face the full brunt of the storm, in all its fury. Up on the face of that giant rock table, there was nothing to slow the winds and no shelter from the rain.

My only chance, my only escape, was an easy-to-overlook exit only two meters wide. The small pathway off the rock was now at the furthest end away from me. There were no other options. I had to find it and get off of Table Rock before the storm took me over.

If I didn't? God help me!

Springing into motion, I scrambled back over the snaggletoothed surface, jumping over its mirrored puddles, and leaping across its shallow ravines. With every stride, I picked up speed, fueled now by shots of adrenaline being fired off, coursing through my veins.

I continued on and on, running and jumping as best I could over the jagged floor. I didn't have time to rest. I had to press on regardless.

It didn't take long for my legs to begin to tire. They were already worn out from the long hike up to get here.

I pushed on as far as I could before eventually having to stop and catch my breath. As I slowed to a shorter pace, I looked around, knowing I needed to figure out where I was. If I wasn't careful, I could easily overshoot my exit. I needed to make sure I was headed in the right direction.

Glancing around me, I looked in every direction hoping to see something familiar, something to orient me to my location. But with the wind increasing, the clouds were rushing in, making it difficult to see very far.

I saw nothing. Nothing but sharp wet black rock.

I was hoping to see the large human-shaped rocks somewhere on the horizon. They were virtually the only thing of significance that I could see from any distance, and they marked the halfway point.

*Where are they?*

Earlier, on my way across to the lookout, the rock floor, riddled with dips, ravines and rocks, made it nearly impossible to identify any unique features to mark my way. I had assumed I wouldn't have to worry about it. I thought I would have plenty of time to walk the edge if I happened to miss the exit somehow.

But now, I had nothing to go on. My only option was to make my best guess and continue again toward the exit. The rock markers would show themselves soon enough...I hoped.

After only a short distance, I began to notice something. The light around me was starting to change. The once bright day had begun to turn a darker shade of grey.

The light was beginning to dim.

I looked behind me toward the cliff lookout, afraid to discover what I already knew I'd see.

A colossal wave of coal-black cloud erupted up over the cliff's edge, shooting straight up into the sky, swallowing the sun whole.

The blood in my veins went ice-cold, sending a chill up the length of my spine. The sheer power and speed with which the storm was moving were terrifying.

I turned back around, running again in the direction of the exit, pushing myself to gain as much ground as I could.

With each stride, I scanned the horizon, hoping to see the large rock markers and get my bearings. Still nothing. But it didn't matter now. Now, I had to gain as much distance as I could before the storm hit me. I had to get as close to the exit as possible before it was too late.

I threw every ounce of myself into running, as carefully and as fast as I could.

As I ran, an unwelcome thought boiled up in me. What if I were to be trapped up here, exposed to the storm and elements? Was I lost already? Would I be able to survive? Was this it? Was I going to di...

I pushed it aside. I couldn't allow myself to give in, or lose control. For now, I had to stay in the moment. For now, I had to focus on the problem at hand.

## Then Came the Storm

Something was close at my back. I could feel it, lurking behind me.

I wanted to look, but I didn't need to. I already knew what it was.

A few yards ahead, a shallow ravine cut across the rock floor, carving itself from one side to the other. I didn't have time to scamper over it like I did before. I would have to take it in one leap. The gap was just wide enough to make it across. But it would be close call.

So I readied myself, preparing to launch myself across the ravine.

I could feel the beast breathing down my neck. I could hear it opening its mouth wide to devour me.

Any moment now it would swallow me whole.

I didn't know which would come first---the storm or the ravine, but both were here now. But I couldn't think about the threat behind me. I had to focus ahead. It was time to jump.

I held my breath, feeling every muscle beginning to tighten, tensing up in anticipation of both the long leap across and the storm's blow to follow.

I exhaled sharply, replacing it with a gasping breath.

With one desperate motion, I launched forward with every bit of strength I could muscle, not knowing whether the ravine's edge or the storm would meet me first.

I hovered there in that second, suspended in air, held in a dangling moment of pure dread. I could feel time stretching, like a rubber band being pulled apart, knowing it could only stretch so far before it broke, snapping back and stinging me.

Everything around me fell silent, my mind pulling itself into a timeless dimension where it could imagine every outcome and every cost. An entire ballet of emotion, thought, and feeling danced about, acting out a hundred memories in an instant, until...

I felt my foot landing on the other edge.

*I made it across!*

There was no time for small celebrations. I knew what was coming next.

The light around me disappeared as if someone had quickly dropped the dimmer switch.

“Oh my God!” The words burst out of me for a second time. But this time...it was a prayer.

This was it.

I would be in the thick of it now.

First came the rain---hitting me hard and heavy.

An ice-cold deluge of pelting rain landed on me like a thousand frozen needles.
The thundering clamor of the downpouring rain was deafening. It soaked me immediately, from head to toe. Rushing currents of ice-cold water began running over the brim of my hat. There was nowhere safe. The water weaved its way through the unnoticed gaps in my water-*resistent* coat, covering any dry remnants of warm skin.

Then, on the heels of the rain, came the wind.

A gale-force wind burst forth with unrelenting ferocity, hitting me like a brick wall, knocking me off of my ill-prepared feet, and sending me tumbling to the rock floor below.

I pulled myself back up against a nearby rock, glancing around me, only to find the light dimming, shrouded by the storm.

Desperate I looked around for the marker rocks, hoping to see them somewhere on the horizon.

*Where were those rocks?!*

I stood up again, leaning back into the wind and the rain, taking one cautious step after another.

Then, my worst fear…The storm cloud overtook the mountain completely. The once clear mist was replaced by the thick fog of the storm cloud.

Visibility dropped immediately. What was once several yards of visibility, had now become only between a few feet.

My heart sank as the last chance of seeing those statues was lost under the blanket of fog. The only thing I could do is continue in the direction I was going and hope that I would come upon the path off the rock.

I picked up my pace a bit. The cold had now been compounded by the wind and the rain. I needed to get to the other side and out of the full brunt of the storm.

A large ridge of rock appeared from out of the fog ahead of me. I needed to cross over it, but I had to be careful.

The wind seemed to slow for a brief second which seemed a lucky break.

I stepped up onto the ridge and pulled myself up.

As I pulled my other leg over to step down, a booming burst of wind hit me hard, sending me careening to the rocky ground.

My knee took the brunt of the fall, landing square on the edge of a sharp rock jutting out in front of me. The pain shot straight up my leg and all the way up my body.

My right hand caught a larger rock in front of me as I reached for something to grab onto with the other. I was falling...hard. I put my left hand out in front of me, reaching until it finally found a shorter rock. I braced as best I could for my landing but noticed another rock quickly approaching, straight in the line of my head.

At the last second, I was able to push off enough with my right hand to avoid the bare rock. Instead, my head made a direct landing on my left hand, while the rest of my body slammed into the ground.

For a brief moment, the world around me disappeared, covered in a dark shroud. Everything fell silent and the chaos around me disappeared.
