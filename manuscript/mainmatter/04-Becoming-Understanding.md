## The Sheriff

Any other day, the word *Sheriff* appearing on my phone, would have been the last thing I wanted to see.

But today? Today it was solid gold. It may have been a simple text, but it was the next best thing to seeing the distant flashlight of a rescue party.

I quickly rearranged myself, turning my back to the wind and hugging up against the rock. I pressed the brim of my hat into the rock, creating a shelf of sorts. Then I pulled my phone up under my hat and as close to the rock as I could.

I needed to do my best to keep the rain off my phone while texting.

I slid my thumb across the wet screen. With some generous luck, I managed to unlock the phone, switching over to my text.

"I'm Sheriff Jason Pistocio. I'll be in charge of coordinating your search and rescue operation."

A warm wave of hope washed over me. And for the first time since the storm hit, I gave myself permission to pause and let out a sigh of relief.

*Thank God.*

I never imagined a text would mean so much to me. But those fifteen words sparked a much-needed ember of hope inside. The ember quickly grew into a flame. Though small at first, it began to take shape, mustering together all the numb and frozen pieces of my ambition. Melting together, they began to take shape, forming one simple idea---a simple, necessary idea.

*I can make it.*

It was the boost of inspiration that I needed, and those were hard to come by.

I quickly kicked into gear, switching over to my map app, praying that somehow in this mess of a storm, the GPS would work.

It seemed impossible. But somehow my GPS was working. It was spotty, but it was there.

I clicked on the share button and copied over my location, replying to the Sheriff's text.

> “Dropped Pin
>
> [https://goo.gl/maps/NHX­E9PKnyXK2](https://goo.gl/maps/NHX%C2%ADE9PKnyXK2)“

I pressed send...

Nothing happened.

I pressed again...still nothing.

My heart began to sink as the panic began to grow. *Was I going to lose reception? Now?*

I pressed again...and again..and finally, the text flew off.

I stared at the screen. Watching. Waiting. Uttering under shivering breath, "come on, come on...".

I found myself counting the seconds, living an eternity between each one, the next one stretching out longer than the one before.

I was completely fixed in place. I couldn't move. I didn't dare. I had no idea if my signal would be lost. There in that God-forsaken place, this text had been my only solitary hope.

I was staving for it. Feeding off of every status change: sent...received...read.

Now, to wait.

I cradled the phone in my hand. At that moment it was more precious to me than any treasure I had ever received. Never before had I been more aware of the marvel that it truly was. It was a spectacular feat of human ingenuity. It was ingenious. It was...a miracle.

I was lost in the absolute wonder that it was, and my utter dependence upon it. With the simple touch of my finger to the glass, this small brick of metal and plastic sent my exact location on this planet, to the exact person out of the billions of people out there.

The sheer amount of innovation that had to exist to pull off that feat was mind-boggling. Actually, it was more than that. We as humans had created a miracle; an ability that we as humans, until now, could only dream of.

This small gadget stood in flagrant opposition to the furious old world around me. Had someone shown it to me when I was a child, I wouldn't have believed it. Had I traveled back to the early 1900s to show my grandfather the same thing, he would have thought me a witch.

Today, we watched this feat with no real care, dismissing it with the same ease that we dismissed the lighting of a single match.

Here I sat trapped in the unforgiving brutality of our ancient world; of stone and wind and rain. Yet in my hands, I held magic. The wand of human advancement. For which I had never been so grateful.

The dinging sound of the Sheriff's text pulled my attention back to the screen.

“Where did you park your vehicle?”

I wasn't sure what the name of the parking lot was. But I knew that it was across the street from the Robert Lewis Stevenson Cabin Trailhead. I opened my map app again and saw that I was still in Robert Lewis Stevenson Park, which seemed to include Table Rock as well.

I switched back to my text, huddled tighter against the stone, and began to type.

I was relieved to be texting someone, but as I typed, the water posed a significant problem. Each time I typed a letter, the rain, or the water already on the screen, would cause another two or three letters to be selected. Each time I tried to delete the letters, another letter would again be typed.

At any other time, I would have found this humorous.

Somewhere in between the pelting rain and the runoff from the rock, I managed to type a useful phrase.

"Robert Louis Stevensonpk".

I quickly hit send.

*Dang, it!*

The text flew off before I realized the misspelling.

It was of course ridiculous to be obsessed with spelling at a time like that, but for some reason, it felt critical to me.

Sadly, my pudgy hobbit fingers did little to help me type on any of today's mobile phone screens. As a result, I had grown accustomed to the aid of autocorrect. But even autocorrect was powerless against the unceasing barrage of water hitting the screen. As if that wasn’t enough, my numb shivering fingers made it almost impossible to do anything involving fine motor skills.

The water was coming from everywhere, cascading off of everything around me. The frustrating truth was, there was absolutely nothing dry, anywhere. I might as well have been underwater. No matter how I contorted my body, I couldn’t find a way to completely shield the screen. The best I could do was to shake the water off and type as quickly as I could between drownings.

I tried to type ‘*Park*’ again with no success, so I used my left hand like an umbrella. My right thumb did its best to type, but with no success. This time it managed to hit the send key too soon.

“Kk;kkkkkkk;;kkkk; lolol“

*OMG!*

My quivering thumb couldn’t even hit a single 'k'. Not to mention, with my fingers completely numb, it was hard to tell when my finger hit the screen.

It was an untenable situation, to say the least. Here in my hand, I had the means to save my life. But between the rain, the shivering, and the numbness, the phone was becoming nearly useless.

Ever the perfectionist, I felt an overwhelming need to clarify my text.

“Kl my phone is getting wet so it’s getting hard to” was all I could manage before the water took over, landing 20 random letters, which I quickly deleted and just pressed send.

It was hard to know how to communicate my desperation and the direness of my situation. I couldn’t type long sentences, and I didn’t want to use my phone as it would kill my battery.

All I could manage was, “DI’m getting freak out freak out”.

I'm sure I didn't need to inform the Sheriff that I was scared. But something in me, some compulsion, had to share it.

</div>

<div class="section" id="lonely">

## A Lonely Distinction

Being alone on the mountaintop, with no one to share the fear and stress with, was a torture all its own. There was no better way to understand the meaning of comfort in numbers.

Another text popped up. This time from home. “How are you doing? Any update? Love you”

The typed words were warming and welcome, but I needed more. I needed to hear a comforting voice. I couldn’t help it. I knew it would be taxing on my battery. But I needed to feel like I wasn't alone up there. I needed to find some connection with the world that was calm and usual.

I stood up, attempting to grab some better reception, contorting my body in a hopeful effort to shield my phone again from the storm.

It's hard to put into words just how much of a gift it was to talk with the one person I loved more than anyone. We could have talked about the price of tea in China for all I cared.

We talked for around a minute---I didn't dare go any longer. I shared every bit of information I could think of and was glad to find out everything that was happening on the rescue end of things.

To my great relief, I learned that the Sheriff’s office was running point on the rescue. A team of Search & Rescue volunteers had been called into action and were gathering at their base of operation.

Sadly, it hadn't even occurred to me that I would be pulling these people out of their own normal lives and into the drama of my own stupidity. Honestly, I really hadn’t ever had to think much about the Search & Rescue organization, or how it worked. I suppose nobody really did, at least not until they found themselves as I did, being an idiot, unprepared and unplanned, at the mercy of Mother Nature.

The process, as it was explained to me, started with the Sheriff's office contacting their Search & Rescue point person, who would then contact and activate the rest of the on-call team. They would assemble at their base of operation, make plans and gather supplies. From there they would travel to the destination, get set up and launch their expedition to the location of the rescuee.

In my mind, I envisioned some sort of helicopter flying up to lift me off of the rock...too many movies. With the storm, however, that wasn't possible. It would have to be a ground expedition.

Our call ended. I didn’t want it to. But I needed to save my battery. It was my only map, my only communication, my only beacon, and my only source of light.

Truthfully, knowing the plan helped to provide some relief, giving me at least the illusion of control that I needed so much at that very moment. Having a goal to reach for, provided a welcome distraction from my dire state of affairs.

It felt truly encouraging to connect with someone distant from this place. Being lifted from my circumstances gave me the ability to see my situation on the whole.

<div class="section" id="education">

## Special Education

Strange as it may seem, the bigger picture provided a sort of humorous perspective. Well, maybe ironic would be the better word.

Nothing was as I had imagined it.

Right now, all I wanted was to be back in my ordinary, usual life.

But normally, the idea of anything ordinary or typical in life was the very definition of hell to me. I lived for adventure.

I was at the epicenter of the greatest adventure of my life. I was in a fight to the death against Mother Nature herself. It was the stuff of stories (if I ever made it out alive). It should have been exciting.

I had played out my romanticized imaginations a hundred times, always casting myself as the unlikely hero---an overlooked soul, different from all the others, who would come face-to-face against insurmountable odds. I was a minister, so of course, I had God on my side. With my sword of faith in hand, I could take on any foe, with not a single fear or whimper.

But here I sat, huddled against a cold stone edifice, longing, clawing, for any chance to find my escape. Here amidst the most exciting event of my life, all I could think of, all I could hope for, was to be in an ordinary, comfortable, and normal place.

Dear Lord, what I wouldn’t give to be huddled up on our couch at home, eating some preplanned dinner, watching the next episode of whatever TV series. Warm. Full. And dear God….bored. Oh to be bored.

So what happened? Why was this experience so different from my imagination? Why was I afraid? Where was the mood lighting? The gripping soundtrack? The fog machine? The bucket of popcorn?

More importantly, how did I get to a place where I expected nature to come with stadium seating, a hotdog and a small soft drink?

Sadly, it was the kind of fantasy that came on slow. Not in minutes or hours, but in years and decades.

Unbeknownst to me, I had been feeding the delusion bite-by-bite, under the blue-tinted glow of our modern-age marvel, TV. Movie after movie, "reality" tv-series after tv-series, meal after meal of a world where all of life's problems can be fixed in thirty minutes plus commercials.

All the while, I had been staving out the part of me that saw the world as it truly was - the real reality.

I was fully caught up in their stories, night after night, day after day. Fully immersed, usually as the main character, I could see the truth of the world. Never mind the staging, lighting, editing and scripts.

I was a hero all my own, in a story of my making, where I too could climb every mountain and weather any storm. My character was special, with special powers. After all, I was a minister who had God in his back pocket.

Little did I realize that it was this very hubris, this arrogance, that compelled me earlier to continue up the trail to Table Rock. After all of life's trials and tribulations, one might hope I had learned my lesson.

I had not.

Though it was taught to me decades ago, in my youth, I was only now coming to truly understand it.

## The Old Lady & the Cigarette

The warm tropical air was sweet with the fragrance of mango trees and exotic flowers.

The humidity, thick and wet against my face, was whipping my hair about in a haphazard fashion as we rode through the rural countryside of the Philippines. The jeep-esk vehicle bounced along the worn road in rodeo fashion thrusting us every which way possible as it struck the unending potholes.

We were on our way back to home base, in the sleepy town of Laoag City, on the Upper Luzon Island.

I was loving every minute of it.

The year was 1992 and this was my first trip overseas. Everything was new and amazing and I took in the full measure of all the beautiful sights, scents, colors, and warmth of the Filipino people and countryside.

Johnnie, a local Filipino minister---also our host, driver, and translator--- was taking his time in getting to our destination. Our day was over, so he was gleefully driving me down several different roads and byways, pointing out any number of unique local treasures. Each one had a story of its own.

He knew I was having the time of my life and seemed to take great joy in showing off his home.

For a teenage boy from Montana, this was an unbelievable journey; an experience of epic proportions. I was thrilled to be in a foreign culture, in a foreign land; to see people who were as different from me as different could be.

I had never seen a world so unlike my own. It was truly foreign.

The fact is, back then the only means I had to see such exotic people was by looking at the pictures of an Encyclopedia, or in the pages of a National Geographic Magazine.

But the people around me looked nothing like the pictures I had seen. Based solely upon those, I should have expected to see groups of scantily clothed tribespeople, standing in some posed group photo with never a smile to be found.

This was all, of course, shortly before the Information Age---on the modern edge of our ancient world. The internet was just in its infancy and there was still no World-Wide Web. No cell phones, or digital cameras. No Google Earth. So to experience a foreign land was not a very common experience, even then.

We were there on a mission to provide medical relief and the "Good Message" to the Filippino people. Generally speaking, for much of the country, it was still difficult to find access to medical care. So we never seemed to lack in numbers.

My parents had felt a strong call, as did we kids, to travel there and bring what we could in the way of medical supplies with us. So now we were here, with nothing but my father ( a family doctor), my mother (a refugee resettlement agent), my sister and I (my brother had left for college), some sparse luggage, and two massive boxes of pharmaceuticals that were donated to us. My Dad had spent months asking for donations from his pharmaceutical company representatives.

It was a simple operation. We would work with a local church that would host and feed us. First, we would set up a clinic at the church so we could help the local townspeople. Then we would be taken deep into the jungle to one or two small barrios (villages), where we would set up makeshift clinics.

My mother would serve as the triage nurse in the front tent. My dad would diagnose and treat the local people, who had often traveled miles on foot. My younger sister served as the pharmacy assistant, doling out the prescriptions per the doc’s orders. The pastor and I would serve as ministers and counselors, offering prayer and a listening ear. I also found myself in charge of whatever miscellaneous activity was needed, which I loved: entertaining the kids, logistics, or doing pretty much anything else necessary.

This particular day had been especially long, hot and muggy. So I was glad to be finishing and was enjoying the ride back into town.

The jeep had been well-used. Driving on jungle roads would have taken a toll on any vehicle. It seemed pieced together in areas, often boasting of some innovative solutions. The metal side door on my side, for example, remained locked with a combination of duck tape, fishing line, and pure luck. With every puddle or hole in the road, the door would swing back at me, each time singeing a few more hairs off my bare leg.

The seats, covered with faded, cracked, and duck-taped vinyl, might as well have been flypaper for as much as they stuck to my legs. For whatever reason, each time Johnnie came to a corner, or turn, he seemed determined to create a new world record in g-force. Of course, each time he tore around the bend, my bare legs would tare off of the vinyl seat, sounding like duck tape being ripped away.

I’m pretty sure I saw him smiling.

After a short while, we came to the edge of Laoag city. Johnnie turned to me, hollering over the clamoring engine, "I'm going to make a quick stop."

I smiled back, shrugging my shoulders with an agreeable indifference.

We made our way to what seemed like a residential area. After a few minutes, we turned down the final side street.

As we coasted down the gravel road, he seemed to be eyeing something ahead. A boyish smile began to creep across his face, culminating finally in an involuntary chuckle. The car began to slow to a steady crawl.

Up ahead I could see an elderly lady, slowly sweeping the dirt and weeds off of her backyard pathway.

I felt an elbow quickly jabbing my side and turned to find John gesturing my attention up ahead. We slowly approached the lady, who seemed completely oblivious to our arrival.

The lady, who was in a world all her own, seemed to be sweeping in step to some upbeat rhythm in her head. One small hopping step was followed by a sweep of her broom to the right. The next, sweeping the other way, with a hop to the left.  And so on.

As she danced back and forth, I noticed large puffs of smoke billowing up in the air above her. They hang in her wake like the billowing puffs of an old-fashioned steam-engine train, rolling down its tracks.

We finally came to a stop at the end of her path, where a dilapidated chain-link gate hung there, precarious on its hinges. I sat, quiet and still, waiting to discover what exactly we were doing there, and why Johnnie seemed to be so delighted.

Without warning, he raised his right arm, shooting it straight up into the air. There it hovered in dramatic fashion, as he relished every second of his yet-unknown plan. Then, swiftly dropping his arm, he re-directed the palm of his hand, landing squarely on top of the horn.

The jeep brayed out a train-like sound that sent the poor old lady shooting straight up into the air.

I looked back in astonishment to Johnnie, who continued to hold the horn for what seemed like a solid five seconds. A massive Cheshire grin spread across his face. It was the kind of smile I had seen on my own my brother during each of the thousand pranks he played on me, and I on him.

I turned back to the old lady who was still somehow floating in the air, while all of her belongings came crashing down around her.

Like a cat out of its nine lives, she somehow landed upright on her feet.

Everything she had lay spread out around her on the ground. Everything, except two solitary items. In her left hand, she held the broom, grasping it by one or two small whisps of the straw side. In her other hand, wedged between two fingers, sat a smoldering half-smoked cigarette, raised high above her head as if she were holding the baby Jesus himself.

I sat there engrossed in the unfolding event, waiting anxiously to see what would happen next.

She paused for a brief moment, abruptly throwing the broom to the ground. She placed her free hand on her chest and took a couple of deep breaths, no doubt making sure her heart hadn’t stopped.

After a couple of seconds, having calmed herself, she slowly brought her cigarette down towards her, the ash falling free as her hand shook from the fright. Carefully placing the cigarette to her mouth, she took a deliberate drag, filling her lungs with a final push of nicotine.

The pastor eagerly poked me in the back a few times as we continued to anticipate her reaction.

Brushing her dress off with her free hand, she took a deep breath. Then, with surprising speed, she swiveled around on one foot, whirling her head around last, making every effort to dramatize the effect.

Across her face flashed a look that could have killed. She pursed her lips into a snarling discontent. I prepared for what I was sure was going to be a tirade of choice remarks.

Then, in a twist of fate, the lady’s face dropped sharply, from utter anger into a bewildered, gawking gaze. She just stood there speechless, looking ahead with a blank stare. But wasn't looking at the pastor...she was looking at me.

I turned to the pastor, wondering what on earth was going on.

He placed his hand on my shoulder and said, "Brother, she's never seen a white person before."

It was understandable, and it wasn't the first time I had been stared at on the trip. Being a beefy Montana boy with pale Scottish skin, I found myself an object of curiosity for local on-lookers, not to mention those who wanted to comment on how "fat" I was.

Clearly, this kind lady was equally spellbound.

She continued to stand there, frozen in her gaze, allowing the burning embers of her cigarette to finally reach her hand. It jolted her out of her stupor and brought her attention back to the issue at hand. She lifted her head slightly, attempting to look behind and around me to find the true culprit.

The fire instantly returned to her eyes as she reared back, ready again for her onslaught.

What happened next was an experience that has stuck with me my entire life.

As soon as she saw Johnnie, she recognized him immediately. With a sharp gasp, she stopped dead in her tracks.

All of the fury and flame burning across her face, dropped in an instant. She just stood there, frozen, with a look of surprise.

The pastor, who was currently using me as a human shield, finally leaned forward, off to my side.  He said only a few words in Tagalog, their national language, and then waited.

The poor old lady stood there for a moment, absolutely unsure of what to do. She looked back at me, then at the pastor, then back at me, then back to the pastor, trying to figure out what her next move should be.

The pastor said something again. But this time he motioned, with the same wagging finger my parents had used on me a hundred times.

She took a step back, her face falling into a look that caught me by surprise. It wasn't a look I was expecting to see here in this foreign culture, seven-thousand miles away from my own people and culture.

It was a look I had seen a thousand times.

What happened next, was a moment of true, unadulterated humanity. I watched as this elderly Filipino lady’s face, once burning with indignation, crumbled apart, reduced to one single, childlike expression...Shame.

All at once the old lady disappeared, replaced now by a little girl who looked as if she had just been discovered with her hand in the cookie jar.

It was a look I knew all too well.

At that very moment, the world around me changed.

This moment, which should have been hilarious, instead caused my heart to sink into a deep disappointment and delusion.

I had been riding on a high, taking in the spectacle of this exotic world, blown away at how easily we could help them...and how important that made me feel. In their eyes I was a magical being, bringing magical pills that could heal the sick. They had come from miles around, often walking on foot, to get the magic pills that could save themselves or their loved ones.

It had been so miraculous and magical; almost romantic.

Now, all of the romanticism, and all of that magic, had been delivered a decimating blow. What was left, was somehow shallow, common, unromantic, and usual.

For the first time, I saw this lady, not as someone who represented the many differences between us. Now she was something else.

She was human...a human being. Exactly like me.

Everything around me changed. In that moment, this strange world around me had become just another place like my own home. I was no longer surrounded by foreign people, I was surrounded by human beings who were just like me, my family and my friends.

The trip changed for me in an instant, snatching me from my fairytale journey, and placing me on a simple walk down the street from my house. It was utterly devastating, and I couldn't for the life of me understand why.

The pastor finally said something else in Tagalog. She paused and said something back. I have no idea what they said to one another, but I didn’t need to. It was clear as could be, merely from the intonation and how they said it. It was the same tune we sang to one another at home; a familiar song being played on different instruments, but holding the same melody through and through.

Normally I might have joined Johnny in finding the moment as hilarious as he did. But at that moment, I was only able to fake a meager smile. On the inside, I was completely blown away.

We had flown to the other side of the world. I was in a foreign land, amidst a foreign culture and people. Everything was supposed to be different. She looked different from me, talked differently than I did, and did things differently from me.

But there amidst our differences, among the plethora of obvious distinctions, there was s singular similarity. A sameness. A commonness.

Everything in this foreign nation was supposed to be different. But here I was, in a remote village on the upper-Luzan Island, watching a human being go through the exact same emotions that I had and would a thousand times in my own life.

Up to that point, I had thought of every nation on this earth as somehow different than the other. But now I had discovered something I never realized before. We may live in separate nations, and experience our lives in a myriad of different ways. But there amidst the distinctions, there had always remained one undeniable truth.

Together, we are human.

## A Tough Decision

A text from the Sheriff took me out of my thoughts and placed me right back into the cruel reality around me.

"Working on getting someone to you as quickly as possible. Relax as much as you can and keep the phone dry. No reason to worry, keep your ears open for other hikers or trail in your immediate area."

It was a welcome relief to see the text and to know that there was a plan of action.

The Sheriff's words were such an encouragement, so I found myself reading them over and over again. But something was hitting me as I continued to read the words aloud to myself.

"...relax...keep the phone dry...no reason to worry"

Initially, I figured that the Sheriff was trying to help me calm down by using positive remarks. But the more I read them, the more I became concerned.

It went without saying that I needed to relax as much as possible. That much was a given. But "keep the phone dry"? Did he think that there was merely a sprinkling of rain up here, or that I had some sort of shelter to keep the rain off? Did he think that I had lots of options up here?

"No reason to worry"? I knew he was trying to keep me from losing control and making stupid(er) decisions. But for some reason, it struck a chord of concern in me.

I wondered, was the weather just average down where he was? Did he not know that up on the top of the mountain, the temperatures were dropping to freezing, the rain was a torrential deluge, and the wind was a steady twenty to thirty miles per hour?

There were, in fact, *plenty* of reasons to worry.

The reality was that my body temperature was dropping fast. I was soaked to the core and the unrelenting rain was pulling my body temperature down at an alarming rate. My ability to escape was substantially diminished due to the lack of visibility, and the fact that I was surrounded on all sides by perilous cliffs.

There was something even more concerning to me. The shivering that had taken over much of my muscle control, was beginning to go away. I knew it was a bad sign. All signs were pointing to me moving into the next stage of hypothermia.

The sun would be setting in another hour. It wasn't likely that Search & Rescue would get to me before then. After the sun went down, the temperature would drop, and I honestly did know if I could survive.

Soon I would begin to lose my ability to think rationally. I would begin to lose my ability to control my body and movements. Worse, I would begin to make decisions that would further jeopardize my safety amidst all of the many dangers around me.

I was going to have to make an impossible choice, between two options.

The first option was to stay put and continue waiting for Search & Rescue.

The second was to take another chance, search for the exit path, and make my way back to the trailhead.

Both options posed their own risks. But I knew sooner or later, I would have to decide on one of them.
