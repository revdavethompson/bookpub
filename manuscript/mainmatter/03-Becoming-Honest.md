## Finding Shelter

A silent hesitation held the line as the four simple words, *I need your help*, surrendered their shocking blow.

It broke me---the silence.

A flood of sentiment filled the soundless void with a decade of memories, all pouring out at once. A great deluge of emotion, of celebrations and setbacks, of hardships and ease, of *I'm sorry's* and *I love you's*. I swallowed hard against the lump welling up in my throat. Pausing for a moment, I took a deep breath, holding it forcefully, doing my best not to divulge the full weight and peril of my predicament.

I knew what came next, and it scared me. To admit it meant admitting the true threat of my situation. My pain and panic faded into the background, replaced by an overwhelming reluctance for my next step.

I had to tell the truth. If I didn't, I would never make it off this rock alive. On the other hand, I knew what this would cost, not for me, for my marriage.

Here on this side of the phone call, I was the only one in peril. On the other side, life was typical. People were going about their day as usual.

Until now, I was facing this alone; the chaos, the cold, the pain, the fear. But now, I would have to plunge someone innocent, someone I loved, into my peril, right along with me.

I didn't have any time to waste, and I knew there was no way to sugarcoat it. So I took another deep breath and began.

"I'm sorry, babe, but I'm in a really bad place. I can't find a way off this rock. Even if I do, I don't know that I'll be able to see the trail back home. I can't see anything further than about ten feet. I'm completely soaked. My body temperature is dropping, and I can't stop it." I paused, afraid to answer the question I knew was coming next.

"What can I do?"

I never thought I would ever have to utter this phrase, but I had no other options. Not if I wanted to live.

"I need you to call Search and Rescue. "

Another pause held the line. It was a terrible shock. So I waited.

"OK. I'll get started on it. Are you OK?" Came the reply.

"I'm OK for now, babe. It's pouring rain and cold up here. I need to find some sort of shelter so I can think about what to do next. Thank you for helping. I'm so sorry to hit you with all of this."

"Oh my God, babe. That sounds so scary. Is there anything else I can do?"

"Not at the moment, love. Thank you."

We both waited there in silence, resisting as long as we could, to end the call. But the storm was relentless, and every second was critical.

Fighting every urge I had to stay on the line, I knew I couldn't waste any time. "Damn. I've got to get going. I don't want to end the call, but I need to get busy finding a way off the top of this rock. I'll call you in a little bit, once I've found some shelter."

As I began to close and utter the three words I had so often taken for granted. Something hit me. I had no idea how long the cell reception would last.

I didn't know whether my phone would survive the incessant rain. So every moment it worked was a moment it could suddenly give out without warning. Every word I uttered could very well be the last one. It was not a thought I wanted to consider, but I knew it was the truth.

I held my breath against my tightening stomach, holding back my watering eyes, knowing these words might mean more than they ever had before. I propped up the phone close against my lips. I needed them to be heard clearly.

"I love you."

"I love you too." The words wrapped themselves around me like a warm blanket.

I let the phone down from my ear, looking down at the screen. A picture of the two of us lit a glow against the dreary mist. I couldn't bear to do it, to end the call. I just stood there looking at it. In a trance, split between two equal tensions of happiness and despair.

A raging gust of wind knocked me forward, breaking my stance and my focus.

The wind had shifted fiercely, this time driving its pelting rain against my ear. It bore itself deep into the side of my skull like a jagged-edged icepick.

I had to go.

I reached over to press the red hang-up button, but nothing happened. The water was everywhere, and the screen was drenched, making it nearly impossible to interact. I clicked the button once more. This time it worked.

The call ended, breaking the illusion of my comfort and security. I found myself once again alone, back on the mountain, on top of the rock, in the iron-cold claws of the tempest.

My next step was clear. I had to find some sort of shelter.

But how? How would I find anything when I couldn't even see through the soupy haze?

The unforgiving rock lay all around me, shrouding itself under the chaos. To make matters worse, earlier, in my search for the exit off, I hadn't found even one tree or bush, or any plant life for that matter. How would I find any shelter?

I placed my phone inside my jacket pocket. It was the only place with some semblance of protection from the rain. I hugged my arms around my body, attempting to place my hands under my armpits.

I was surprised to find them difficult to move. Out of curiosity, I held them straight out in front of me. They were shaking violently. I tried to force them to be still, but I had no control over them. I smiled oddly to myself, thinking that in any typical setting, this might be humorous.

But the humor retreated at once, replaced by the looming dread of my progressing hypothermia.

I took a quick inventory of my body. I was shaking everywhere. The tremors had nearly taken over. All I could do was stand there helpless to control them. Every muscle in my body was convulsing and straining to create some modicum of heat. They were fighting, struggling, to keep my body temperature from dropping any further, or at least to slow the pace.

The panic began to grow in me again. No matter what I tried, no matter what I did, there was no relief. It was utter helplessness and I was unaccustomed to the feeling.

I had to start walking. I needed to do anything and everything I could to maintain my heat. The longer I remained exposed on top of the flat rock, the more the storm would steal warmth from my already chilled body.

While scouting around the last section of the cliff, I seemed to recall seeing something large and prominent just off the edge. As far as finding something to block the wind and rain, it was my only chance, and likely my only hope, for shelter.

I turned and began heading in a straight line toward my last marker of piled rocks.

A frightening thought came to mind. If the wind had pushed me over, what about my markers? What if the wind had somehow blown them over?

Once more the panic and adrenalin crept up inside me. But this time, it was a gift, giving me a much-needed boost of strength to walk against the wind and pick up my pace.

It was a strenuous walk. With every footstep, I leaned dramatically into the gusting storm.

After a short while, the mist opened for the briefest of moments. I thought I saw something off to my left. Just on the edge of the mist, I could almost mark out a pile of rocks on the ground. But as quickly as the cloud had opened, it closed up again, swallowing my sightline.

*Was that my pile?*

I was hesitant to change direction. I thought I was headed in the right direction. The gusting wind, however, had made it difficult to know if I was walking in a straight line.

Regardless, I decided to switch directions and head that way. It was a risk, but so was everything at this point.

After a few steps, I looked forward in front of me...nothing.

Then a few more steps...nothing.

*Just one victory*, I thought to myself. *Just one*.

I began to turn around and head back. Just then, the mist gave way again. The view in front of me opened up. There it was, the last pile I made. Thankfully I had laid the stones differently from the others, so I could tell it was the last one.

I looked down the slope from the pile, and saw a large stone not too far away, to my great relief.

It was a victory. A small one, nonetheless a victory, and those were in short supply. Filled with some hope, I made my way quickly over to it before the haze took it over again.

The slope began to take a steep pitch. I had to move carefully. Every step needed to be a cautious one. I still didn't know what lay beyond.

## The Ebenezer Stone

As I approached the large rock, I could see the floor changing into loose shale and gravel, dropping off suddenly after only three or four feet. There wasn't much room for error. But if I could make my way to the lee of the stone, I could find some shelter from the wind.

A large manzanita bush sitting just to the side could provide something to grab onto as I carefully made my way around the stone.

I took ahold of one of the larger branches, grasping it down by its roots. Then, swinging myself around, I pulled myself up into the stone's shelter.

The rain was still showering down on me. But the rock cut down some of the wind, which would at least slow the loss of body heat.

It wasn't much, but I was grateful for any break I could get.

The hulking stone loomed over me, ominously marking my meager refuge like a headstone atop a grave. It would provide a fitting monument to the place where I might very well meet my end.

I leaned into the roughhewn stone, pressing my back in as close as possible, doing my best to shield myself from the unrelenting storm. The wall of rock was anything but flat, jutting out in random places, making every effort to render me as unwelcome as possible.

To my great relief, the wind was cut down dramatically.

The rainwater, however, was everywhere, enveloping everything. It poured off the rock in steady streams, spilling onto my hat, then cascading to the saturated shale below.

Trickling down my neck and under my jacket, it gathered in icy pools within the arms of my jacket. I lowered my hands, extending my arms downward, allowing the water to run out of my sleeves---an action I would have to repeat every few minutes.

</div>

<div class="section" id="think">

## Time To Think

Being finally, in some semblance of shelter, I chalked up another small victory on the board.

At last, I had an opportunity to rest, if only for a moment. For the first time since the storm struck, I was able to pause, take an inventory of my situation, and form a plan.

Up till now, I was only just reacting to each threat as quickly as possible. My mind, no longer being interrupted by yet another hazard, turned itself to its next important task, assessing my injuries and the state of my body.

Now being without distraction, I found myself able to Every part of me was aching. But it wasn't simply the result of sore muscles or joints. Yes, there was that. But this was different---it was deeper.

The cold had long since rendered my arms and legs numb to the touch. But beneath, the cold pressed in, tightening down like a cast-iron vise being steadily sinched down.

My muscles, forced to frantically create any heat they could, cramped and constricted themselves, pulling against the bone. Locked in a tightening tug-of-war against each other with a tension nearly enough to snap the bone in two.

It never relented. Not for a second. No matter what I did. No matter how I moved.

There was nothing I could do to ease it, so I did my best to put it out of my mind. Instead, I gave myself over to the more pressing need for a plan. I hadn't had time to think about a strategy, and I was in dire need of one.

My first issue...time.

If I wasn't able to find a way off the rock, how long would it take for Search & Rescue to find me? They were likely just now being contacted.

I constructed a mental list in my mind of everything they would need to do, and how long it might take to do it:

* Call and assemble their team - 30 min.
* Assess the situation and make a plan - 15 min.
* Drive to the trailhead and prepare for the hike - 30 min.
* Begin hiking and making their way to my location. - 2 hrs.
* Somehow locate me while navigating the rock and the storm - 30 or more min.

Altogether I was looking at about nearly four hours at the earliest for my rescue.

*Four Hours?!*

The truth of it hit me hard.

How was I going to last four hours in this storm?

For the first time, I came to understand the full weight and cost of my choice to continue on to Table Rock.

*What the hell was I thinking?!*

My thoughts fell into an abyss of regret.

My early decisions. My lack of preparation. They fed a wave of anger deep inside me, anger at myself.

I was furious at my naivety and my lack of respect for nature. This was not how I was supposed to go into the woods, and I knew it. After all of my many years growing up in the woods of Montana---camping, fishing, hunting, hiking, etc.---I knew better.

I didn't want to acknowledge it, but the truth is, I had become comfortable in our modern world. I had given in to the deceptive ease of human advancement, with its luxuries, technology, and convenience. It was all too easy to do.

In our modern world, I no longer had to live in constant fear of nature. Instead, I watched the outdoors on high-definition tv, ate pizza that came in a box, and complained about the air conditioner being too cold.

But here and now, pressing myself into the cold stone slab for shelter, I was at the mercy of the old world---the true reality TV. Here there was no comfortable couch, no heater, and no fridge full of food.

This was the world we humans knew well and had existed in since we first started walking on this earth. That is, until the last few generations. Now it was a world often overlooked. It may not have been obvious, but we were and had always been, at its mercy.

I knew this, or at least I was supposed to.

Huddled now against an ancient stone from our ancient world, I was going to be reminded. This was my lesson now, to be schooled again in its beauty and brutality, its delight and death...of the full measure of its power.

This was nature.

I was fighting it…and it was winning.

I clicked the mechanical power button on my new-world phone, glancing at the time and the temperature. Modern human or not, I was still amazed that I had cell reception on this rock, while at the same time fighting for my life to survive. It was a perfect irony and the simplest example of our actual human reality.

It was nearing three o'clock, and the temperature had dropped from 44 to 38 degrees.

I knew that the sun would set soon. I knew the night was coming, and I knew what that meant.

I was hungry, exhausted, and utterly drained. I had already hiked three miles up and down thirteen hundred feet of rocky terrain, which was grueling for my out-of-shape robust physique. My body had spent what little remaining strength it had, navigating the rocks while searching for the exit. Now my muscles were being further weakened by the constant shivering.

Though I had already run the calculations and considered all the factors, there was a hopeful chance that I would make it out and survive. But there was also another possibility.

I was an eternal optimist. I always had been. But for the first time since the storm caught me, I had time to consider an honest reflection of what very well could happen to me. Yes, there was a possibility that I could make it. But there was another option that I had to consider, one that held the greatest likelihood.

I was going to die.

It hit me hard.

I was going to die. Alone.

Drowning underneath this unforgiving rain. Beaten and battered by the winds.

Finally, and inevitably I would drift off into the shivering slumber of an endless sleep.

I was genuinely terrified, in a way that I had never been before.

This could very well be it---the moment that I, and every other human, always wondered about. When I came to death's door, what would I do? What would I think? What would I say?

Hugging my knees into a fetal position, shivering to the point of convulsion, I sat in Death's waiting room---the in-between moment---nervous to hear my number called. I would finally be walking through that unmarked door, into the unknown and uncertain.

What was behind that door? Was it annihilation? Was it Heaven? Was it a torturous Hell? Was it nothing...nothing at all?

As a minister. I thought I knew exactly what I would say and what I would do. I would ask, in a humble and stoic manner, for Heaven, and for my wrongdoings not to be counted against me.

In my mind, it was a romanticized moment filled primarily with peace and calm and hopeful expectations. I did, however, leave a few things to chance...for instance, I figured I might either fall to my face in humility or raise my waving hands saying, "Take me home, Lord!"

But there was no more time to speculate. Now I was here. Now I was facing death square-on.

How did I feel? What did I want to say?

I looked deep inside myself, searching for some answer, waiting for some sort of grand emotion.

I took a breath and opened my mouth to say whatever it was I would say.

But no words came to me.

Instead, a shivering sigh of breath blew out, forming a cloud of surprise, floating off and disappearing into the mist beyond.

I felt…nothing.

I said...nothing.

I was numb. Alone. Empty.

I looked out into the thick misty cloud with a dismal stare, like a child having found his birthday present empty. For the first time in my unconventional life and ministry, I felt a sense of absolute disappointment in myself, in my faith.

After all the many years of contemplation, prayer, ministry, listening and writing...was I now without an answer?

Did I truly have nothing? Nothing at all?!

</div>

<div class="section" id="uncertain">

## A Necessary Uncertainty

An unsettling thought presented itself, filling my empty answer with an even emptier realization. It planted itself dead-center, in the middle of my mind, building a vision of itself in front of me. It carried me forward, into the cloud, further and further into the soupy haze. Floating into the nothingness, I saw myself breaking apart, scattered into the nothing. A billion pieces of me breaking up into a billion more---into cells, then molecules, then atoms, all dispersing into the clouded mist. Every piece of me was swirling and mixing in with every piece of nature until neither was indistinguishable from the other.

The answer had finally presented itself, but not as a speculation, or some guess about what would come. The answer came in the form of honesty and truth, of what I knew was undeniably true...

> "for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return" (Genesis 3:19)

It was one of the first earliest phrases in my own faith's scriptures.

It was also an observable, measurable, law of science.

I could feel my body sinking into the ground beneath me, weighed down under the crushing gravity of the honest truth---in our most basic elements, there was absolutely no difference.

Atoms, electrons, quarks, strings. We, and everything else, were only just one giant churning cloud of particles, acting and reacting...cause and effect.

Of all the many moments of disappointment and despair in my life, I felt perhaps the greatest disillusion that I ever had.

Here I was. Somehow a being. Human. Different not in my elements, but only in my assembly. A massive Lego set made up of the same sharp-edged blocks as every other piece of matter.

The question was this...

Was that it? Was I just a momentary hodgepodge of atoms? No Soul, No God, No Heaven, No Hell?

The unwanted answers came without apology...

*I don't know.* and "Either option is just as likely as the other."

It was crushing.

I had come face to face with the reality that I could very well stop existing...completely.

To be frank, I hadn't actually considered that possibility. Not really. I never gave it significant thought or examined its consequences and meaning.

I sat there with a blank stare, in a state of shock.

I had come on this hike to ask myself one question, praying that God would help me come to some conclusion…As a human being on this planet, what do I truly believe---about the unanswered questions, God, faith, etc.?

I was getting exactly what I asked for.

</div>

<div class="section" id="if-there">

## If You Really Are There

For the majority of my life, I was much like other people of the Christian religion. Beneath the many diverse expressions of our faith, there was generally one common belief.

After the moment of my death, I would continue as an immortal soul of some sort. I would stand before the Creator of the Universe and answer for all of the good and bad things I had done. The verdict of course would either lead me up to Heaven or cast me down into a burning lake of fire where I'd burn forever and ever, without mercy or relent.

I had already faced the prospect that there may be no God at all.

Now I was facing the real possibility that God existed and it was all true.

As a minister I had, of course, spent most of my life with the latter assumption. Now I needed to prepare myself for my pending moment of death.

I was standing on the precipice of the final account for my life. I was about to meet my maker.

If that was the case, then In these last moments, I was going to state my case and have it out with God, once and for all---on this side of the grave.

Mustering what little strength I had left, I braced myself against the face of the stone, raised myself up slowly on my numbed feet, and attempted to secure some better footing in the loose shale beneath me.

I should've remained seated. The small amount of shelter from the stone was diminished even more while standing. But I stood nonetheless. It felt important...and right.

I had no idea what I was going to say, but one thing I did know was that the volcano of a life's worth of emotion and dedication to God was about to erupt out of me, all at once.

All of the many hurts and persecutions. All of the doubts and inconsistencies. All of the ambiguities and unknowns. All of the unattainable notions of perfection. All of the immovable rules. All of them had been held together in a giant reservoir of the unexplained. The great dam of my earnest devotion had been met with a crushing blow. Now, it would burst forth, an angry flooding torrent of them all, pouring out at once, begging for their reckoning.

"GOD!!!" I bellowed into the storm's pelting rain, "If you really are there. We need to talk!"

I fell silent.

"If you really are there?" I echoed under my breath, taken aback by my own flagrant doubt.

But even more, I was furious, and for the first time, I realized it.

*What in God's name did I just say?!*

My doubt and anger weren't the surprise. It was the timing, the raw unbridled emotion, and the impertinence that startled me.

It wasn't that I was worried about angering God or being vaporized by a lightning bolt from Heaven. I had never really worried about being honest when praying, or talking to God.

Instead, it was the kind of shock that comes from hurting someone you love, when words are said that can never be unsaid when they leave a permanent scar.

I felt a profound sadness. A substantial loss. I had come to realize the answer to my most fundamental question…*do I believe in God?*

The answer: *I honestly did not know.*

I had true doubt.

After all of my studies. After a lifetime of debate and discussion. I was uncertain.

But why doubt now? Why question God, who could save me when I needed it most? Wouldn't it have been safer to hedge my bets and choose words with a kinder outcome?

I had only one reason. Honesty.

Of all of the most important things I could be at that moment, being honest, was my only option. It was absolutely necessary.

What was I going to do? Lie? To myself? To God?

Now facing the likelihood of my death, I didn't have any choice. I was reduced to the truth of what I knew and what I didn't know. The rest was uncertain...and it was a necessary uncertainty.

There was no way to honestly know. No human could observe or prove God. There was no way to touch, smell, taste, hear, or see God. There certainly was no way to provide others with a way to do so.

Regardless of what religion, prophets, or pastors might claim, that was honesty.

But there was another side to that uncertainty, one that left me with some measure of comfort.

It was possible that God did somehow exist...maybe not as some bearded guy in the clouds, but somehow.

It was impossible to escape the unknown and unprovable. Either something came from truly nothing, or something is eternal and has always existed. Neither were observable or reproducible.

In our scientific age. That was a hard truth to recognize. We still don't know everything. There are mysteries. That was also honest.

But as I sat there, wrestling through my doubt, I felt a grave injustice toward something that I couldn’t let go of. Yes, we might be the only life in this universe. But that wasn't the only possibility. There existed another.

Grasping now onto the hope of survival and holding onto every morsel of life that I could, I couldn't help but acknowledge a glaring undeniable fact.

I was alive, and we were alive. In this universe, there was life and intelligent life.

We were our own evidence and answer to the question of whether there could be other life out there. Our simple existence proved it. Out of the unfathomable chaos, we were here, and we proved it was possible.

Was it such a leap to then think that there could be another being? An older being. Even a far more advanced being.

A sort of relief came over me. It was small but significant. Yes, we had no proof of God's existence. But we did have proof of our existence. The universe had been around for at least 13.8 billion years, if not for far longer. It seemed ridiculous to suggest that no other life had come along in all of that time. Were we that arrogant?

It compelled me to speak as honestly to God as I could, without presumption. "OK, God. I'm not going to talk to you like a Christian or a believer. I'm only going to talk to you as a human being, like everyone else. I want to start in the same place that every other person in this world starts."

The doubt that had so surprised me was now morphing into something else; a sense of wisdom and necessity. "I just want to be honest, so here's the honest truth…I don't know if you exist. I might just be talking to the wind. But…on the other hand, it's entirely possible that you do exist."

It was hardly a safe speech to be offering a being that might actually determine some sort of justice and sentencing after my death. But I pressed on.

"I have absolutely no way of knowing for sure which faith is true. You know that I have tried my best to figure it out.” I wasn't sure what I stood to gain, but I had to be sincere.

“Can I tell you what I do know? I’m here. I am a human being, like everyone else. None of us know exactly how we got here, but we know we are here. We don’t know where this universe came from, but we know it’s here. If we are here, then it’s possible you are here too. Maybe we got here first. Maybe you got here first. Maybe you've been around since before this universe began. Maybe you're so advanced that you exist in a way that we can't even fathom yet. If we have advanced so much in just a hundred years, what will we look like in another hundred, or thousand?”

I hovered on the thought for a while. *God*. What did that word even mean? Some random bearded grandpa-looking person sitting on a cloud?

I needed to turn my attention back to the storm, but I wanted to offer one final thought. “God, I used to think of myself as being different, or better than other people because I somehow chose the right faith. But the truth is, I’m just like every other human being. All we know is that we exist and that we each have to make our best guess where the rest is concerned.”

The mist began parting in front of me. The view beyond the edge of the rock opened up, revealing a drop-off of solid stone before me, cascading down into a steep ravine. It was a pleasant view that any other day would be a welcome vista. But today was a further testament to the improbability of my escape.

It was hard to believe, but it felt as if the rain had actually increased. I tucked my head forward, attempting to shelter the rest of my body with the rim of my wool hat. Would there ever come a break?

The mist poured into the clearing, filling the ravine below me, creeping upward like a scene out of some frightening horror film.

At that very moment, to my welcome surprise, a brief flicker of hope among the dreariness…I felt my phone vibrating in my pocket.

It still worked. I still had a chance. I could still make it.

I held the phone up, directly under the rim of my hat. The screen glowed reassuringly, drowning out the impending and dreary grey, revealing one single word.

One desperately needed word.

"Sheriff".
