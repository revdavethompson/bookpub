It was an enormous victory, and I needed it.

Standing there next to that Table Rock sign, I desperately clung to my triumph, begging time to stretch its seconds into minutes, so I could take in the fullest possible measure.

But like all the truly treasured times of life, they never lasted for long. Neither could this. The sun would be setting soon.

I turned myself around to the trail.

Somewhere in the invisible beyond, the rangers were making their way toward me. And beyond them, my terrified spouse waited, ready with warm dry clothes to see me walking off the trailhead, finally ending the nightmare.

The hike off would be a callous climb; steep and unforgiving. The trail cascaded down into a deep ravine below. There at its base, a creekbed carved its way between the two towering peaks, bearing the scars of a millennium of flooding waters. It cut an undeviating path, plummeting from the mountaintops above, descending down to the valley floor below.

Past that creekbed, I knew what lay waiting. A menacing maze of paths invited me to test them, deviating off in different directions. They would pose one of my greatest threats. The rangers were expecting to find me on top of Table Rock. They had no way of knowing that I was hiking down the trail. There was a strong chance that we could find ourselves walking on separate paths, becoming two ships passing in the fog.

<div class="section" id="down">

## Down the Mountainside

It was time.

I pressed my fingers to my lips and placed them affectionately on the sign. It was hard to leave the proof of my escape behind, but I had to.

Glancing down at my weary feet, I wondered how much further they could take me. In any case, I started with the simple set of movements I had mastered at the age of one. This time, however, it was a monumental effort.

Like rolling a giant bolder, getting started required far more work than keeping it going.

I drug a lead-weighted foot out from under me, swinging it forward erratically, like an artificial limb with which I had yet to become familiar. I had taken the first footstep. The ball was rolling now and I set off down the steep trail, one stammering step at a time.

The sharp angle of the trail began to become a benefit. The further I went, the more my pace picked up, and I was glad for it. I knew I didn't have much light left. Each step meant one more step away from the rock and another step closer to the rangers ahead. But I had to be careful. Too much momentum and I could go tumbling headlong.

Having finally reached the base of the ravine, I stood now on the edge of the once-empty creek.

I watched in jaw-dropping disbelief as the now-flooded creek surged past me. The deluge of relentless rains rushed by in the rapids, rolling over the sawtoothed rocks. It spilled down through the canyon until finally, it cascaded off a steep drop to the valley below.

The trail ended abruptly in front of me, swallowed by the water's edge. It was too wide and too deep to cross. I would have to look for a better place to cut over.

Normally I wouldn't give a second thought to walking through a rushing stream, or even a river. But I couldn't take any chances in my condition. The current was too fast and the water was too cold. Between my lack of coordination and the hypothermia, it was a recipe for disaster.

Looking downstream I could see a spot where the ravine was narrowest. It might be deeper there, but I would at least have the rocks on either side to grab hold of. That would be my best bet.

I made my way over, traversing the side of the rock till I had reached the narrow gap.

I surveyed the crossing. It was too wide to jump across. I would have to wade into the water and take a hard leap, to the other side.

Slowly and carefully, I began to lower myself down. I took hold of a couple of branches from a bush nearby and began to position myself.

The current was stronger than I expected and the rocks beneath were slippery. But I managed to find a stable stance.

</div>

<div class="section" id="crossing">

## Crossing to The Other Side

I let go of the tree branches and leaned forward, lowering my weight slightly into the water. Then, with all the strength I could gather, I lunged forward, jumping across to the other side.

As my foot landed, I hurriedly reached out to grab ahold of the rock in front of me. Just as my fingertips reached the stone's edge, my foot slipped out from under me and sent me crashing into the water. The stream's current grabbed hold of me, pulling me under and whisking me down the ravine at a startling speed.

I desperately attempted to reach out and grab ahold of something; anything. With numb hands, all I could do was continue grabbing at imaginary objects. But nothing held and I continued being swept down the raging river.

In a last-ditch effort, I kicked my legs out, making as wide a stance as possible.

It worked.

I caught myself between two rocks and quickly grabbed ahold of a nearby branch, pulling up with everything I had. I slowly dragged myself to the other side.

I reached up the shoreline, finally finding a large rock to hoist myself up onto.

I laid myself out on the jagged rock floor, welcoming the pelting rain to the drowning stream. In some ironic way, I was grateful to be unable to feel the ice-cold water.

Sprawled out now on that stony floor, I lay there motionless; a dying fish spent from swimming against the stream. All I wanted was to remain. But I knew the longer I stayed, the harder it would be to start again.

I began commanding myself to stand, making every effort to pull myself up off the ground. But despite all my efforts, nothing was happening. Something was holding me down.

An immense weighted mass of emotions lay over me, pressing me into the rock.

I had pulled myself free of the creek's current. But the current had pulled me under, back into the nightmare on that mountaintop, and all that happened there. All the fear and panic. All the anger and confusion. All the loss and pain. They weaved themselves together into a burdened blanket, soaked with my emotions, and confining me to the rock floor.

Up till that point, I had only been reacting to every obstacle I faced. Action and reaction. Threat and survival.

I had yet to take a single moment to reflect on all that happened up there. All that I had lost. All that I had discovered. All that I had learned.

It hit me altogether at once.

In the short span of a few hours, I had lost nearly every part of me; of who I thought I was. Up on that rock, I lost more than just my strength or my way.

So much more.

Scattered across the naked stone of Table Rock, the many severed and shattered parts of me lay defeated, the spoils of a war I had lost.

In one pile, lay the relics of my long-held and broken beliefs, a faith of sorts, stripped down to its most undeniable (and uncertain) parts by my necessary honesty.

In another, lay a heap of my many discarded distinctions; all the diverse differences I once found so important.

In still another, my trust and hope in the unmeasurable and untestable claims of magic and mystics.

In the last pile, remained a mound of my unquestioned and impossible ideals.

In short, I had been stripped of everything except my most essential elements; the immovable, permanent, and absolute parts.

Now, I had crossed over the river, baptized beneath its rushing waters.

But this time I wasn't made new. I was made old, tied back to something ancient and fundamental. It was the only truly honest, understandable, measurable, achievable rule; that I was just like everyone else, and together, we were human.

What arose from those waters?

Nothing. Nothing but a human being. A commoner. No different than any other person that lived or has ever lived before.

I had been re-installed; a human factory reset.

There would be only one place to start now; at the beginning. Just as I had to consider every cautious step on this trail, so I would have to contemplate each truth and every rule.

Now, they would have to be forever negotiated against the trial of that rock. They would have to answer each question I was forced to ask: Were these rules honest about what could and couldn't be observed? Were they understandable in every human context? Were they built on measurable proofs? Were they humanly achievable?

At first, it seemed too overwhelming. But I realized something.

I had been given a blank, and erasable slate. I could finally negotiate and change as needed, as the universe did, free from the chains of my past.

I wanted to stay there, laying on that rock, contemplating every moment I had experienced. But I couldn't. I knew if I stayed any longer, I would drift off into that endless sleep.

It was time to get up and begin my way again, up the trail.

</div>

<div class="section" id="steep">

## A Steep Climb

I managed a slow roll to my side and prepared to stand. Inch by inch I hoisted myself up to my feet. Finally, I found myself standing upright, balancing again on uncertain legs and appreciating the accomplishment.

I lifted my head and eyed the massive mountain before me. The path was steep and formidable, but I pushed it out of my mind.

All I needed to do was to focus on one step at a time. That would be enough for now.

I leaned forward and managed to take a single step, but my once limber muscles and joints were now stiff and unyielding.

Regardless, I knew I had no choice but to continue. If I was going to make it up the hill, I would have to use every weapon in my arsenal.

As a person, more especially as a minister, I have generally attempted to maintain some control over my choice of language. But to motivate myself at that moment, I had to use every possible means at my disposal. Suffice it to say, a trail of expletives lingered along the trail behind me.

The only time I can remember rattling off so many obscenities was when my brother and I chose to canoe down the Clearwater River from Seeley Lake. Both of us being well-built boys, we found ourselves rarely afloat and constantly bottoming our vessel on the shallow rocks below.

I'm pretty sure we carried that canoe for at least half the three-mile trip.

My thin river sandals made for a wealth of frustration walking over the wet rocks and logs. To this day my brother claims he has yet to hear anyone curse so much in a four-hour window.

</div>

<div class="section" id="think">

## The Trail, I Think

I continued up the steep trail, making a steady climb up the mountainside. It was rough going, but thankfully after a while, the trail began to level off to the right, hugging the side of the rocky ridge above.

After a few minutes, I saw something in the distance.

As I approached, the trail diverged into three equally possible paths continuing on into the distance.

As noted before, the maze of trails would make it difficult to figure out which paths were the trail, which were alternate routes, and which were dead-ends. Previous hikers had made every effort to indicate the dead-end paths for other would-be Table Rock'ers, laying down sticks or rocks at the false trails.

I looked carefully over each entrance, hoping to see some mark or designation to help me choose. There were no sticks. No rocks. Even if there had been, the water rushing down the mountainside had long since removed any possible signs placed in the paths.

I looked as far down each trail as I could. Maybe I would see some indication that the trail would close off. Still nothing. Neither option looked any different from the other.

There was no other choice. I would have to roll the dice and make my best bet. So I threw in my wager and chose to cut down the middle, hoping for the best. Even so, I tried to pick up my pace a bit, just in case I chose the wrong path and needed to double back to the fork again.

As I continued, I kept my eyes open for any sign that the trail might be closing off. The path seemed to continue without interruption. For now, it appeared I had chosen the right path.

I was relieved.

I continued for a good distance, but soon, I noticed my legs were beginning to shake more and more, making it difficult to balance. I would need to stop and rest for a spell.

I took a break, knowing I couldn't stop for long

Over the last stretch of trail, my head had begun pounding. I assumed my neck muscles were sore from staring down at my feet for so long.

I stretched my neck back and gazed up through the falling rain. It helped.

As I stood there looking up, I noticed something. The storm clouds above me had darkened into an ominous charcoal grey.

At first, I assumed I was in for an even stronger downpour. But as I started to glance around me, I became aware of a more concerning problem.

It wasn't the clouds that were getting darker. It was the daylight. The sun was beginning to set.

It was going to get dark, and soon, and I was out of time. I would only have about fifteen minutes before I lost all light. Before the sunset, I needed to gain as much ground as possible.

I cut my break short and started again, continuing on as best I could. Meanwhile, the light continued to fade around me. The trail was rocky but clear enough that I could keep a steady pace even in the lowering light.

As I looked on ahead I could see a problem. The trail was splitting off again with more offshoots.

This was going to be a difficult and critical choice. Whichever way I chose, I'd have to commit to the end. If I picked the wrong path, I wouldn't have enough light to find my way back.

As I approached, I took a quick glance down each path. I had to consider every angle I could.

One of them meandered off to the left, and a bit backward. The shrubs on each side were thick and a bit overgrown. It was safe to say it was a dead-end.

The remaining two were nearly identical. Both went uphill. One doglegged to the right, and the other took a sharp turn to the left.

The trail to the left seemed to climb at a much steeper pitch. I had some doubts. It went straight up toward the towering ridgeline above. The other path, however, continued on at a steadier grade, a bit more in the direction I was already going.

It was a fifty-fifty choice. There was no way of knowing for sure, but I decided to stay to the right, rather than head up the trail toward the mountain ridgeline.

I tried to pick up my pace again. But to be frank, I'm not sure it made any practical difference.

To my relief, the trail remained wide and open. It seemed to be the right choice, so I committed myself to it and decided I would go as far as possible before I stopped again.

As I marched on, the light began to fade with quickening speed, creating a growing sense of panic and worry.

The dark was coming.

I wondered whether the rangers would be using flashlights. Would I be able to see them? Would they be able to see me? Worse, would the maze of paths make it possible that both I and the rangers would pass each other on separate trails?

I tried to push the thought aside. Instead, I focused all my mental energies on moving forward.

I didn't know how much further I could go. Every step had already been a labored effort in and of itself. But now, with each added step I took, I could feel my legs beginning to give way more and more.

</div>

<div class="section" id="tunnel">

## The End of The Tunnel

I continued on, each step slowing more than the previous. I pressed on until I couldn't press on any further, until...

As I took my next few steps, I began to hear the leaves of the scrub brush rubbing against my jacket.

I had been focusing so much attention on my feet that I had neglected to keep looking on ahead. As I lifted my head, I saw something, something that killed every modicum of hope I had remaining.

Just a few yards in front of me, the trail began to close off, swallowed by the encroaching brush on either side.

*Oh, God!*

My heart sank into the granite floor beneath me, tunneling itself deep into the bedrock.

I knew what this meant.

I was no longer on the main trail.

I had spent what little strength I had, and what little light I had, walking up the wrong path.

The daylight around me was fading away, revealing still darker shades of grey. My shadow began to fade, ferried away by the dwindling twilight. As it drifted off, so did every measure of optimism I had remaining.

I prepared myself for the panic to set in.

But panic was not what I felt.

It was something else this time. Something fiercer. It was anger.

No. It was more than anger.

It was rage.

The ruthless reality before me struck with an unforgiving blow. There would be no way for me to make my way back to the trail before the light completely fell away. It would be pitch dark. Dark and raining. Dark, raining, and cold.

Now, not only was I nowhere to be found on the rock, I wasn't even on the main trail. There would be no way for the rangers to find me.

This was where I was going to die.

The sum total of everything I had accomplished came crashing down. The critical lessons I had learned. The moments of mortal anguish. All of them would be rendered futile, as the reality of death engulfed me, like the brush devouring the trail ahead.

The anger and frustration continued boiling up. It grew with an enormous force, adding to it the fury of every broken hope.

More and more the rage built, fueled by the memory of every challenge I had survived. Up it came with an explosive force, building till it could no longer be contained.

It erupted...

"FUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!"

I screamed the obscenity with every fiber of my being and every ounce of breath I could yield, howling like a rabid beast.

I had had it. I was done. Finished. I couldn't take it anymore.

My head throbbed, pulsing from the pressure of the fiery blood flushing my face. Every sense began to fall away as the world around me circled into a dizzying spin.

I came crumbling down, an epic demolition, falling into a cloud of its own ashes. I caught myself on one knee before hitting the ground.

I just wanted it to be done; to be over.

I didn't care how anymore. Whether by salvation or my demise.

All I wanted was to sit down, lean into the brush, and finally fall off into the gentle sleep that had been unceasingly calling me by name.

At least it would be easy. I wouldn't feel a thing. It would be so...peaceful.

I hovered there in the easy embrace of that restful end. Why not? I had given it my best.

I hated the thought of the hurt it would cause. But up there, alone in the dark, under the unrelenting rain, what did it matter? For me, there would be nothing but stillness and rest. Pure, peaceful, lasting rest.

For the briefest moment, I allowed myself to give in. I felt my body begin to relax, grateful for the opportunity to let go, at long last.

But as I allowed myself to slip away, something brought me to a halt.

I simply couldn't do it.

Something in me refused. Something wanted me to press on, just as I had been pressing on ever since the nightmare began.

The truth is, I couldn't give up willingly. I couldn't decide of my own volition to surrender. Instead, I could only press on till my body itself gave up on me. If I made it, I made it. If I didn't, I didn't. But one thing was for sure, it wouldn't be because I decided to stop.

</div>

<div class="section" id="push">

## One Last Push

After so many times pushing my body, I doubted I could do it once more.

But I didn't care.

A sort of primitive survival instinct took over. It somehow managed to pull me up from the ground.

I turned around and continued doing exactly what I had been doing since the beginning. I kept on keeping on.

Cautious of each step, I continued my same mechanical movement in slow motion, like walking underwater. Move leg. Lean forward. Plant foot. One after the other.

With each step, I continued to lose my balance a little more. Each time my legs shook more and more.

The light began to disappear at a rapid pace until suddenly it was pitch dark. I wasn't even halfway back to the trail. But all I could do was to continue: leg, lean, foot.

Now I couldn't see.

As I felt the bushes on either side brush against me, I realized I could correct my direction slightly to stay on the trail. But I knew it would only work for so long. I remembered the brush would grow thinner and more scattered the closer I got to the main trail.

The world around became cloaked in absolute darkness. It was a dark I had never experienced before. The absence of light was worsened by the loud sound of the heavy rain. The combined diminishment of every human sense created a blackness darker than any color, or lack thereof could describe.

There in that blackness, I began to humbly accept my fate. I greeted it with a quiet nod.

My body was giving in.

I took my remaining last step and stopped. I stood there, staring blindly into the void, seeing nothing but my fate, and strangely, my peace.

In that nothingness of aloneness and absence, I saw something from beneath my heavy eyelids. There, amidst the drawing curtain of darkness, a light began to show at the tunnel's end, pulling me toward it.

I knew what it meant.

It was time, and I was ready.

I waited there, unable to go any further, sending a single word to every part of my enfeebled body.

*Rest*.

One by one I felt every frozen muscle thaw, every tension melt away, and every caution fall into calm. A deep sedating wave washed over me like warm honey being poured down my body.

I felt myself beginning to slowly sink.

The distant light continued to grow, flickering toward me, luring me in.

As I welcomed it, staring blankly ahead, another light appeared, just to the right of it.

I stood there confused for a moment, but too tired to care. I had already given myself over.

The two lights continued calling me into the distance.

Then they were joined by a third.

I immediately dismissed it. It was just another illusion, a mirage induced by the hypothermia that was now taking me over.

But then I heard it...my name.

"Daaaaaaaaave!!"

"Daaaaaviiiid!!"

"Dave!!"

Three distinct voices hollered out in the dark distance.

I teetered there, swaying between two blurry distinctions of delusion and reality. I wasn't willing to trust either one.

"Daaaaaaaave!!"

The voices called again, this time a bit louder and perhaps a bit closer.

The lights grew brighter and more distinct. Were they flashlights?

I wasn't sure what to believe. But between hallucination and hope, I had to choose hope.

I took a deep and heaving breath and let it go with a crazed and frantic scream.

"Hellooooo!!!"

The voices and the lights stopped, frozen in a startled surprise.

I took another weary breath and hollered again, "Hellooooo!!"

Immediately the voices began shouting my name and waving their flashlights, moving toward me at a quickening pace.

It was the rangers!

There is no description that can best encapsulate the feeling I had at that moment. Neither elation, nor joy, nor glee; not even the combination thereof. There was no way to express it because I had never felt it before.

Regardless, it yielded a spring of strength that lifted me up and placed me somehow squarely back on my feet again.

I stumbled as best I could in their direction, but rather than bother, I decided to let them come to me.

</div>

<div class="section" id="now">

## Say What Now?

As soon as they reached me, one of the rangers asked, "Are you Dave Thompson?"

I nodded, attempting to say yes, but too exhausted.

"It's a good thing you yelled when you did. We would have walked right past you."

I put on a smile but all I wanted to do was cry.

One of the rangers handed me a thermos of water and told me to drink it slowly. I reached out and attempted to take hold of it, but I couldn't manage to grip it. He pulled both my hands together around it so I could hold it and drink.

The water was warm and ran down through my body like a soothing shiver.

Was I dehydrated? I hadn't actually considered that possibility. The whole idea of needing water had been completely lost on me. All my attention had been focused on getting away from the pouring rain. The irony was not lost on me.

Another ranger handed me a trail bar and asked me to eat it. I eagerly complied. The only thing I had eaten that day was the brownie from Angelina's Bakery, back in Lakeport that morning. They were sizable and absolutely delicious, but it was hardly enough to sustain me through everything that had happened.

I sat there devouring the trail bar for a moment. Then one of the rangers began to ask me a series of questions; an assessment of sorts.

"Dave, I need to ask you some questions. Do you think you can answer a few?" He asked.

I promptly replied, "Of course!"

I thought I was coming across as alert and coherent. In truth, I sounded more like a well-sauced sponge, slurring my words together.

He asked his first question. "Can you tell me your full name?"

I gave a happy nod, replying "David...Andrew.............Thompsssson."

Next, he asked, "What's the date today?"

I put on a confident smile and opened my mouth to answer. Nothing came out.

Nothing came out, because I had nothing to say. I had no earthly idea what the date was.

It was a strange and unfamiliar experience. I knew that I knew. But somehow at the same time, I didn't know.

I stammered for a few seconds, "Ummm...uh.....ummmmm..."

Still nothing.

He tried another question, "How about the President? Do you know who the President is?"

I was moderately annoyed by the obvious question. Of *course*, I knew.

I took a deep breath and began to answer, "Yeah! It's ummmm..."

Nothing. Just, nothing. It was like trying to use a browser, without the internet. I was offline.

It was unnerving and frustrating, and scary.

The ranger asked a final question, "Can you tell me what day it is today?"

I knew this one, replying with a hasty attempt, "Yeah. It's uhhh....um...uh."

I couldn't believe it. I *knew* what day it was. It was right there in my easy-to-access, no-duh memory banks. But when I went there to access them, the shutters simply would not open. They were frozen shut.

"It's okay, Dave. There's nothing to worry about. I just need to get a handle on your condition. It looks like you are well into hypothermia. But you'll be ok now."

The words were a welcome relief.

For the first time since this nightmare had begun, I was finally able to let go. I could finally let my guard down.

We remained there for some time while I rested, eating more trail bars, and drinking more water. They handed me several pocket warmers, placing them wherever they could put one. The warmth felt amazing.

After I had come around a bit, the ranger who questioned me turned back toward me with a stern and serious look. He asked, "Do you think you can make it back down the trail?"

The thought hadn't even occurred to me. I was too busy dwelling in the ecstasy of my rescue. I hadn't even considered getting back to the trailhead. The thought of it brought a sobering reality, landing on my leisure like a massive sack of cement.

I had already spent every ounce of energy I had, now they wanted me to keep going?

In my mind, for whatever reason, I had conjured up the idea of being carried off on a stretcher, or some sort of off-road vehicle. Now, of course, it made no sense at all. I suppose the ludicrous idea of being carried back was the sort of thing that one dreams up in those moments of tired desperation, like a starving person imagining a meat-lovers pizza the size of a house.

In truth, I was grateful that I wasn't in a condition where they would need a stretcher.

Instead, I considered myself fortunate and gave a reluctant nod in the affirmative.

My shock at the suggestion was obvious enough to catch the ranger's attention. He reached over and put an empathetic hand on my shoulder, saying, "I know it seems like a lot, but I also know you can do it. Right now we can wait and let you rest a bit. When you're ready, we can start hiking again. Don't worry. We'll stop as many times as it takes along the way. But Dave, your body temperature is too low. We need to get you out of the rain and get your temperature up. The exercise will help with that."

I knew what he spoke was true. As much as I wanted to ignore it, I needed to get back on my feet and start up the trail back home.

After a few more minutes, I pulled together what drive I had remaining and let the ranger know I was ready to start. He reached out and offered his hand, pulling me up till I was standing on my feet, holding me there till I found some stability.

I was surprised to find how much the heat, the water, and the food had strengthened me. It was still difficult to walk, but the fact that I could actually do so was encouraging enough.

We began the first part of the hike back, up the trail, climbing at a steep grade. For the first several minutes, all I could manage was four or five steps at a time. I wish I could say I was able to pick up my pace, but for the first half of the hike back, all I could manage was a handful of steps at a time. We'd stop to rest, take a drink of water, and press on again.

Finally, we made it to the top of the steep grade. It was a relief to know that the remainder of the trail would be easier.

I stood there resting before our final push, taking one last look at the chaos around me.

Every element of danger remained. The wind continued howling. The rain continued to pour down with a fury. The cold continued to bite.

But I was found, and that was all that mattered.

After a short while, we rounded the corner of the trail atop the mountain. The cloudy haze that had blinded me for so long, remained behind, seized in the stone grip of the mountain peaks.

Shining the flashlights down before us, I could see the fog beginning to lift, revealing a well-worn soft dirt trail ahead. It stretched lazily downward, embraced on either side by the lush ferns and tall thick trees of the green side of the mountain.

It was a comforting relief from the rock and stone.

As we began our steady stride toward the trailhead, the ranger next to me turned and joked, "What do you think? Should we do a light jog?"

I let out a welcome laugh and took in a deep breath.

It was all downhill from here.
