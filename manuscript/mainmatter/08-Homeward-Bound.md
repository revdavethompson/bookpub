# Homeward Bound

The comfort of a well-maintained trail lay before me, meandering down through the misty greens of the lush fern-hemmed forest.

It might as well have been the path to Heaven itself.

Beneath my feet, the spongy soft-cushioned floor of mixed gravel and wood chips marked a welcome contrast to the callous and barren rock of the mountain I had left behind.

The gentle trail seemed a simple luxury. But like most comforts, they were easy to overlook until having to suffer their absence.

The muffled steps of the rangers barely made a noticeable sound against the crackle of the pouring rain. It was a constant reminder that we were not out of the woods just yet.

For now, I was surrounded by the rangers, an immeasurable miracle. But still, even walking in their protection, I struggled to accept my rescue, safety, and survival.

A lingering suspicion held me captive, creating an inescapable sense of looming danger. On the one hand, I wanted desperately to give myself over to my relief and the comfort of safety. On the other hand, a nagging worry pestered me with the possibility that this was yet another sleep-induced fantasy.

I couldn't help but wonder. Would I soon find myself jolted awake from this fiction? Would I find myself alone, crumpled up on the trail, facing it all over again? Or worse, was this my last dying dream from which I would never wake?

Regardless, dream or not, I couldn't let fear and paranoia take me over. Instead, I made every effort to embrace the truth before me; that I had been rescued.

## Only Human

My sense of panic and dread slowly began falling away, much to my relief. I was hoping for a more positive emotion to take its place. Instead, something else moved in. Something unexpected.

Embarrassment.

I suddenly realized the inevitable outcome of this hike. I would now be *that* guy; a Search & Rescue statistic.

The rock had served up a whopping lifesize dose of humility.

I was now one of the dim-witted hikers I had always read about; another eye-roll-inducing rescue story. Yet again, some lone idiot had decided to go traversing up rocky cliffs during a storm, with nigh a scrap of safety gear nor adequate supplies.

The whole fiasco unveiled something that I had never before registered. Underneath the humbling reality of my poor judgment, dwelt something even more foolish.

I had a grandiose sense of entitlement.

It was an arrogance really, a hidden hubris that had compelled me that morning. It swindled me into ignoring every caution, and instead persuaded me to continue further up the trail, all the way to Table Rock.

In my mind, I continued up the trail because I had to. It wasn't part of my initial plan, but I still needed more time to think. That was more important to me than any danger I might pose to myself, or trauma I might inflict on others.

It seemed so glaring to me now, my sense of privilege. How had I not seen it there before? The truth was, however, it had been there for a very long time.

Something had ingrained it in me since my youth

It was my faith.

I was a Christian, and a Minister to boot.

Buried under the enormity of the many sermons, studies, stories and experiences I had acquired, there was one teaching burned into my mind that was greater than them all.

God had created the universe. In my mind, and in the mind of countless others, it stood to reason that he was above the rules he put in place. He was above the universal laws of science, of cause and effect, homeostasis, thermal dynamics, etc.

It seemed harmless enough. But over the long years, this simple notion had grown into a dangerous assumption. If I devoted myself to a God who was above natural law, wouldn't he keep me immune from it as well?

Here's the thing -- If someone were to have asked me if I thought I could ignore danger, I would have categorically denied it.

But wasn't that exactly what I had just done?

 On this hike, I came to the mountain to talk to God, and to consider my beliefs and my calling. So surely God would protect me from anything overtly life-threatening in the process.

Whether I knew it or not, I had become conceited with an assumption that I was somehow more than just the common fair of human being.

I was special.

Somehow I had come to believe that I had nothing to fear, especially from "God's handiwork", the outdoors.

Not only was I special because I was raised in the Rocky Mountains of Montana, but I was a person of faith. I was a Christian. Even more than that, I was a Minister.

Little did I realize that this sense of self-importance had recklessly directed me, long before I ever came to the mountain. It had been compelling me most of my life; a well-rehearsed script and mantra I had been reciting for decades.

*I am special. I am special. I am special.*

But this time, I was in for a rude awakening. This time, my blind luck and life of generous opportunity weren't enough to save me. This time, I had overstepped and the Mountain was eager to relieve me of my assumptions, to teach me a raw and brutal truth.

I was not special after all.

Here, walking in step with my rescuers, the reality of it became painfully obvious. I had now been reduced to the pure, carnal nature of who and what I was.

I had become human.

Yet, there was something surprising and liberating about it. No longer was I locked into some detached assumption of importance, and all the isolation that came with it. I was now on a new level; the very same as each of the rangers. We were a new kind of family, united by our humanity.

There were no distinctions, no divisions or differences.

It was a space all its own, where every one of us held our same basic needs and desires in common.

This was a human space.

So what drove them to help me?

They didn't stop to ask me anything before they placed their lives in jeopardy for my sake. They didn't stop to preach their faith, to change my vote, or to lecture me about how I should live.

I could have cared less about who they were. In my fight to stay alive, I didn't give a single thought to our differences. In my moment of despair, it didn't matter. I needed them because they were human and they could save me from death.

They were there because of what we held in common. They were there because they were human too. They understood the unyielding struggle for survival. They also knew there might come a day when they too would have to rely on another human being for the same.

<div class="section" id="question">

## A Good Question

After a short break, we continued along down the gentle sloping trail. With every new step, I allowed myself to slowly and cautiously embrace my rescue, and with that, what lay ahead.

For the first time since the rangers found me, I allowed my thoughts to wander to something more pleasant. The promise of the trail's soon end captivated my full attention.

A feeling of warmth washed over me as I envisioned my other half of eight years waiting for me, ready with a warm embrace and a dry change of clothes.

The alluring thought took me over and filled me with renewed focus and energy. I channeled it into my walk and attempted to pick up my pace.

One of the rangers noticed.

Likely to assess my improvement, he moved in a bit closer, bumping my arm. He asked, "So what do you do for work?"

I stared blankly at the ground, having no idea what to say.

Like before, when I was asked what day it was, I had no reply.

This time, however, it wasn't because I couldn't remember. This time it was because I simply wasn't sure. Though his question was simple, the answer was anything but.

It wasn't his fault. That very question had been plaguing me for a long while now, long before I had even set foot on this mountain trail.

*What do I do for work?*

The question turned over and over in my still-sluggish mind, offering little in the way of a helpful response.

I realized his immediate concern was to check my mental state. So for the sake of showing improvement, I responded with the simplest answer I could muster.

"I'm a Minister," I replied.

The ranger responded with what could best be described as a less---than---enthusiastic, "Ah."

After a couple of slightly awkward seconds, one of the other rangers quipped back, "I bet this will make for quite a sermon."

I countered with as cordial a laugh as I could manage.

The truth? The ranger's question (and reply) hit me directly in the sternum, knocking the wind right out of me, and leaving me gasping for an answer.

"*Minister*", I slowly whispered under my breath.

What in the world did that even mean anymore?

Truth be told, it did describe much of my life and work. I was a licensed and ordained minister after all.

Ever since I was a youngster, I wanted to be a minister. Following my *calling*, I went on to study formal ministry at a university long-ago founded by ministers; translating ancient biblical languages, studying theology and philosophy, learning psychology and family counseling, training in pastoral care and the like.

So much of what I loved was wrapped up in the work of ministry.

That word, *minister*. I had always held it in such reverence.

But over the last number of years, something had changed for me. That title had begun to lose its appeal. In fact, I increasingly found myself reluctant to tell people I was a minister, for fear of what they might associate with it.

In just a few years, the world's perspective of ministers had begun to change. The internet and social media had exposed, for all to see, the true and naked humanity living underneath the minister's collar.

In the mind of many, the word no longer conjured up notions of service and compassion, of self-denial, of dedicating one's self to those in need.

What began as a title of pure humility, from the Latin word for servant, the word *Minister* had now taken on darker hues of greed, deceit, lust and conceit.

Calling myself a minister these days meant that I often had to disassociate myself from all of the terrible things people had seen or heard.

So, rather than having to sift through all that negative baggage, what if I were to call myself something else?

I knew I wanted to serve others. Why not simply call myself a servant?

It made sense, even if it was a bit simplistic.

But it begged the question. Who would I serve? And how?

</div>

<div class="section" id="space">

## A Human Space

As I kicked the question around in my defrosting mind, I took stock of the rangers around me.

*My God! How lucky I was that these three souls were willing to bravely put themselves in danger for someone they didn't even know.*

It was humbling to be dependent upon strangers for my survival. I had done nothing to deserve their courage, except to be an idiot. They didn't know a thing about me, but it didn't matter.

Something sprouted up in my mind, an answer to the question swirling around in my head. It was right here on this trail, surrounding me the whole time.

Walking now beside my rescuers, I couldn't help but see a clear and humbling truth. These brave souls had shown me what it meant to serve, who I should serve, and how I could go about doing it.

It was so simple.

They were human, just like me. They didn't care about our differences. They only cared about what we held in common; our humanity. I was a human in need, and they helped me.

Were they pastors, priests, shamans, or politicians? I had no idea, and it wouldn't have mattered. They didn't care and neither did I.

I was hungry and they gave me something to eat. I was thirsty and they gave me something to drink. I was a stranger and they invited me into their protection. I needed clothing, and they covered me. I was sick and they looked after me. I was in-prisoned by the storm and they came into the storm to find me.

In my faith, there was no greater service or good they could have done.

But these rangers weren't helping me because of a common faith. They were helping me because I was a human in need.

The truth of it flew in the face of so much of what I had experienced in my church community. Our service and generosity were typically given with a generous side of preaching. Our aid and relief were often presented as a reward for enduring a high-pressure sales pitch about our faith and the possible eternal torture of their souls by our loving God.

But for the first time, I could see a different space arising. Walking now with these people, of whom I knew nothing about, our common ground was unrelated to faith, politics or any other distinction. This was human common ground, a space not defined by the differences we shared, but by the similarities that we held in common.

I realized something I had never seen before. There in this critical human space, there was plenty of room to serve others.

I didn't need to join an organization to help others. I didn't need a complicated set of doctrines, or a church membership to help me understand what was self-evident.

I didn't need anyone to tell me that it was good to help my fellow human. I knew it was necessary because we all held that need in common.

There in that human space, there was also a place for morality and ethics that came even before all of our differences. They were necessary for everything else. Without our most basic social rules, there was no way to peacefully live together with our different faiths, our different politics, and our different lifestyles.

That was where I could minister, where I could serve. There in that human space, I could work to bring something I had spent decades building, and our world desperately needed --- a model for finding common ground and building peace.

<div class="section" id="gears">

## Changing Gears

We continued our pace at a steady rate. The ranger was right --- the food, water, and exercise were helping to bring me back from my hypothermia.

After a few minutes of quiet steps, the ranger asked me another question, "So, have you always been a minister?"

Finally, a question I could easily answer. I shook my head saying a simple, "No".

I clarified, "Actually I left the ministry for a while to start a business in marketing and public relations. I primarily worked with political campaigns. Later I worked in software and start-ups for a bit. But eventually, I came back to ministry and wrote a book to help resolve a divisive social issue in our church communities. Since then I've focused on serving ministers and leaders who were having trouble dealing with these issues in their membership, or their personal lives."

"Yeesh. That's a heck of a journey. I bet you've been in the thick of it. Getting people to agree? That's tough work," he replied.

He was dead on. It was tough work at times to be sure.

Divisive issues were just that; divisive. They were highly emotional and often carried a long and deep history of hurt, resentment and anger, especially toward the opposing side.

It was difficult and taxing work, but those moments of reconciliation were what kept me going. Seeing, for example, parents in tears because they had their child back; the one they had disavowed decades before. That was a reward beyond measure. Being a part of healing people's delicate divisions was a momentous honor.

But the truth is, it was lonely work. Often, those of us who practiced peacemaking found little support from either side. Generally, people were more interested in destroying their opposition, than understanding them or finding common ground.

I loved the work, but it had taken a toll on me, especially more recently.

In a very short time, our world had begun dividing itself in ways that were never before possible. The issues I had spent so much of my life addressing, were now dividing people at an exponential rate.

The internet and social media had changed everything.

Our ability to see our differences had now reached across the entire planet. Now, people could divide themselves into different groups, not just in their small community, state, or nation. They could divide themselves on issues around the entire world.

There were plenty of opportunities for me to serve humanity and to provide positive change. Lord knows, there were plenty of people working to divide, and were making billions off of the division industry.

Never before had our need for finding common ground been more essential for our survival. I had more than enough to do in this new human space.

But there was a problem. I was already burnt out. I couldn't continue to work the way I had up till now.

As much as I loved my work, it often felt like I was trying to hit a moving target. The problem with divisive issues is that they never stop changing.

But I began to notice something.

The more issues I addressed, the more I began to realize that the one unchanging constant was the rules I used to move people to common ground.

Over the past twenty years of doing this work in several different contexts, I began to see patterns emerge. As I grew in experience, I began to follow certain rules that helped me find the common ground. Those same rules also gave me a way to avoid many of the landmines that could easily derail the process.

 The thought occurred to me; rather than teaching people about the issues, I could instead teach them about the process. I could show them the rules I learned. That way they could deal with conflict and division on their own, regardless of the issue.

Instead of treating the symptoms, I could work to treat the disease itself --- divisiveness.

So what were those rules, and how could I teach them? That was exactly why I was on this hike.

It was only a month earlier when I first asked myself what those rules were, and wrote them down for the first time. I went on this hike to spend some time thinking about them and what they meant.

## A Cafe of Colliding Worlds

The buttery soft croissant melted in my mouth, freezing time for a fleeting moment of familiarity and delight. The french cafe was an oasis amidst the otherwise overwhelming sounds, scents, and bustling crowds of downtown Hyderabad, India.

Now, I have to say, I love Indian food. A slightly sweet Lamb Korma was always a win for me. But I'll confess, it was nice to be eating something that didn't contain any of the myriads of spices I had encountered over the last few weeks. I was equally happy for a short break from our endless amount of shopping, fittings, and the scheduling of our friend's wedding.

This wedding wouldn't be like any wedding I had experienced before. This was a Hindu wedding, with a week's worth of banquets, celebrations, and ceremonies. Each one came with its list of important items, clothing, and preparation.

The grand succession of these century-old festivities included epic dances, bands, tattooing, parades, giraffes, elephants, horses, and feasts...lots of feasts. The celebrations would reach their pinnacle on the final day, culminating with the couple's wedding.

The final wedding ceremony was an occasion of epic proportions: lavish foods, musicians, priests and processionals. Later that week, in fairytale fashion we would be whisked up the highest hill in a galloping horse-drawn carriage. Racing up the rutted cobblestone road, holding on for dear life, we would, at last, arrive at the royal castle where the wedding ceremony would unfold.

Truth be told, it was a surreal experience. We were humbled to be asked to participate in such a significant religious, cultural and personal moment in the lives of our friends.

Suffice it to say, there were quite a few particulars to be tackled.

Regardless, on this particular day, I chose to find a cafe where I could get out of the way, and instead do some writing and reflecting.

I took a sip of my coffee, opened my journal and stared down at the empty page.

Twenty years of rewarding reconciliations, devastating divisions, and hard-hitting regrets swirled around in my mind.

I had one outcome in mind --- try to determine what I had learned in the process of building common ground. What were the rules I found absolutely necessary? What rules could be agreed on by everyone, regardless of their particular faith conclusions, their politics, or their lifestyle?

It was no small task, but I was anxious to see the result. Throwing back another stiff swig of coffee, I grabbed my pen and set to work.

After it was all said and done, I had written down five rules of engagement:

> 1. We all had to agree to work toward *understanding* each other, clearly defining the words we were using.
> 2. We all had to agree to be *honest* about what we had observed and what we had not, or could not observe.
> 3. We all had to agree to provide *measurable* proof if we asked others to believe our claims.
> 4. We all had to agree to require only what was *achievable* for everyone, without causing suffering.
> 5. We all had to agree to remain *negotiable* and to adapt our rules as needed, so they would continue to meet these expectations in our constantly changing world.

I drew a line across the final page, marking a sense of completion, and exhaustion. I stretched myself out against the wood chair and returned to the table, glancing down at the short list of rules before me.

Something struck me.

Being a word-nerd, I happened to realize that the first letters of each of the main ideas could almost form an acrostic using the word *HUMAN*. I rearranged them and wrote each letter down with its corresponding rule; H-honest, U-understanding, M-measurable, A-achievable, N-negotiable.

I set my pen down and looked down at my journal. As I sat there taking a few more sips of my coffee, staring at my new list, the word HUMAN stared right back at me with an expression of blatant obviousness.

Here I was, an American from Montana, sitting in a French bakery, in the heart of Hyderabad, India. It was the epitome of human difference. But even there, amidst the most obvious contrasts, there was one indivisible truth that removed every difference we could see.

Together we were human.

## Nearing the End

I looked down at the trail beneath me, continuing to stew in my thoughts as I watched my feet plod along the pebbled path.

The howling wind carried on, thrashing about the rustling trees around us. But for the first time, I found myself undisturbed. I was no longer afraid. The chaotic sounds of a hundred different threats fell away, muffled now by a quiet and solemn peace.

I was no longer alone. Instead, the commonness and comradery of a newly realized family surrounded me.

As I began surrendering myself to the understanding of our shared humanity, I found myself, at the same time, resigning my loneliness and panic to the mountain, growing smaller and smaller in the distance.

It was enough for me now just to carry on, wandering the path through the dark misty forest. For now, all I needed to think about was reaching the end of the trail, and then, at long last, my spouse, and home.
