# Preface

This is a sample document whose purpose is to show how CSS can be used
to print a book. To make the document more lively, excerpts from the
third edition of &ldquo;Cascading Style Sheets &mdash; designing for tbe Web&rdquo; have been included. <span class="footnote">That book *was* produced using the methods described in the document, and it was published by Addison-Wesley in 2005.</span> The excerpts have been selected for their example values and they appear, in this document, out of order.

The PDF version of this document is produced directly from the HTML and
CSS sources by the Prince formatter.

We encourage you to reuse the structure, markup and style sheet of this
sample document. In your own book, however, you need to provide the
content yourself.
